213	In my case, I was not frightened in the least bit at the thought that I might live because I was certain, quite certain, that I was already dead.

My spirit, my emotional being whatever you want to call all that inner turmoil that has nothing to do with physical existence, were long gone, dead and gone, and only a mass of the most fucking god-awful excruciating pain like a pair of boiling hot tongs clamped tight around my spine and pressing on al my nerves was left in it's wake.	2025-07-02 10:16:01.399301+00	56	2
214	It`s very hard to win without any problems. To win, you have to fight. And many times, this fight means to indispose in certain ways with some people, to prevail your beliefs. Your point of view, your ideas and your personality above everything. If you don`t fight hard, you lose your own way. And if you lose your own way, you`re nobody. So, to achieve this line of conduct, you have to fight very hard. And in many times, you really have to fight.	2025-07-02 10:16:01.424072+00	57	2
215	Sooner or later we all discover that the big moments in life are not the advertised ones, not the birthdays, the graduations, the weddings, not the great goals achieved. The real milestones are less prepossessing. They come to the door of memory unannounced, stray dogs that amble in, sniff around a bit and simply never leave. Our lives are measured by these. You were born an original. Don't die a copy. There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval. So mine's a double and I'll see you all in hell suckers!	2025-07-02 10:16:01.448532+00	58	2

232	Fantastic doctrines (like Christianity or Islam or Marxism) require unanimity of belief. One dissenter casts doubt on the creed of millions. Thus the fear and the hate; thus the torture chamber, the iron stake, the gallows, the labor camp, the psychiatric ward.	2025-07-02 10:16:01.8603+00	68	2
233	Defiance is beautiful. The defiance of power, especially great or overwhelming power, exalts and glorifies the rebel.	2025-07-02 10:16:01.876064+00	\N	2

236	We live in a time of twin credulities: the hunger for the miraculous combined with a servile awe of science. The mating of the two gives us superstition plus scientism-a Mongoloid metaphysic.	2025-07-02 10:16:01.929061+00	\N	2

252	He's a great writer. If I didn't think so I wouldn't have tried to kill him... I was the champ and when I read his stuff I knew he had something. So I dropped a heavy glass skylight on his head at a drinking party. But you can't kill the guy. He's not human.	2025-07-02 10:16:02.301007+00	80	2
253	Harris really thought he was wonderful. Once he told me he was going to live to be a hundred. When I asked him what the formula was, he told me it was very simple. He said: 'I've bought myself a stomach pump and one half hour after dinner I pump myself out.' Can you imagine that? Well, it didn't work.

254	Each morning I awake, the sky is grey, the trees are bare. A single crow calls my name as I weep into the pillow, wondering when it will ever end.	2025-07-02 10:16:02.352129+00	82	2

261	Certain old men prefer to rise at dawn, taking a cold bath and a long walk with an empty stomach and otherwise mortifying the flesh. They then point with pride to these practices as the cause of their sturdy health and ripe years; the truth being that they are hearty and old, not because of their habits, but in spite of them. The reason we find only robust persons doing this thing is that it has killed all the others who have tried it.	2025-07-02 10:16:02.485854+00	63	2

350	Life... is like a box of chocolates. A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctoral gift that no one ever asks for. Unreturnable because all you get back is another box of chocolates. So, you're stuck with mostly undefinable whipped mint crap, mindlessly wolfed down when there's nothing else to eat while you're watching the game. Sure, once is a while you get a peanut butter cup or an English toffee but it's gone too fast and the taste is fleeting. In the end, you are left with nothing but broken bits filled with hardened jelly and teeth-shattering nuts, which, if you are desperate enough to eat, leaves nothing but an empty box of useless brown paper.	2025-07-02 10:16:04.340071+00	146	2

355	God does not play dice with the universe: He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players [i.e. everybody], to being involved in an obscure and complex variant of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who won't tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.	2025-07-02 10:16:04.442826+00	150	2

375	Think how utterly, evilly selfish it is to have a child. Think of it! "Oh, honey, wouldn't a baby just be splendid? With its little hands, and its little feet and its little arms and legs and face and smile. Oh, we have to have one." Great, and once it's done, here is another little human to have to grow and learn what a sick collection of animals it is into which he's been born; who has to learn the pointlessness of the asinine cycle of human life; the pain and unhappiness that accompany; the stupidity of the majority; the outrage of old age and death; the unfair circumstances of competition amongst organisms; the injustice of suffering, the absurdity of doctrines and ideologies; the cold blade of war; the inner demons of hunger, desire, self-loathing; who will be taught to hate and feel shame and fear and remorse, regret, guilt; who will one day suck from nonexistence another little conscious body to continue the hideous lineage of incessant dark-humor; and who will one day die, wrapped in a urine-stained, hospital-issued death-shroud, plugged into beeping, blipping machines, fed through dripping bags armed with needles and at the mercy of smart-ass little nurses, who know not yet that they, too, will be faced with this end. What more horrific and vile an act than that of having a child? There can be none. Torture is not worse, murder is not worse, nor rape or anything else, because it is birth that precludes them all. Were it not for birth, none of these other atrocities would have even a chance to be performed. It is the miracle of birth and life that drowns the light of the world, and it is that selfish obeyance of desire that is hung over the heads of all parents in the look of disgust on their disaffected teenager's face. How can one repay an infinite offense?	2025-07-02 10:16:04.833701+00	160	2
376	It really comes down to parsimony, economy of explanation. It is possible that your car engine is driven by psychokinetic energy, but if it looks like a petrol engine, smells like a petrol engine and performs exactly as well as a petrol engine, the sensible working hypothesis is that it is a petrol engine.	2025-07-02 10:16:04.857145+00	161	2

Imagine, if you will, a worldwide conspiracy to deny the existence of the color yellow and whenever you saw yellow they told you no, that isn't yellow, what the fuck's yellow? Eventually, whenever you saw yellow, you would say: that isn't yellow, course, it isnt blue or green or purple, or... you'd say it, yes it is, it's yellow, and become increasingly hysterical, and then go quite berserk.	2025-07-02 10:16:06.066489+00	205	2

But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way, nevertheless Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well.

441	I owe Marilyn Monroe a real debtit was because of her that I played the Mocambo, a very popular nightclub in the 50s. She personally called the owner of the Mocambo, and told him she wanted me booked immediately, and if he would do it, she would take a front table every night. She told him  and it was true, due to Marilyns superstar status  that the press would go wild. The owner said yes, and Marilyn was there, front table, every night. The press went overboard. After that, I never had to play a small jazz club again. She was an unusual woman  a little ahead of her times. And she didnt know it.	2025-07-02 10:16:06.681881+00	210	3

570	I wanted revenge; I wanted to dance on the graves of a few people who made me unhappy. It's a pretty infantile way to go through life - I'll show them - but I've done it, and I've got more than I ever dreamed of.	2025-07-02 10:16:09.328551+00	296	3

575	Here it comes, ladies and gentlemen, and what a sight it is, a thrilling one, a marvelous sight... The sun is striking the windows of the observation deck on the westward side and sparkling like glittering jewels on the background of black velvet... Oh! Oh! Oh!... It's burst into flames... get out of the way, please, oh my, this is terrible, oh my, get out of the way, please, it is burning, bursting into flames and is falling... Oh! This is one the worst...

584	I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for someone else's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season."	2025-07-02 10:16:09.614794+00	251	3

Ultimately, it's about me.	2025-07-02 10:16:11.037451+00	342	3
652	Ideas are far more powerful than guns. We don't allow our enemies to have guns, why should we allow them to have ideas?	2025-07-02 10:16:11.077297+00	343	3

745	Everytime I see you, well the rays of the sun are all\nStreaming through the waves in your hair\nAnd every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight\nThe beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost\nAnd it's looking for a rhythm like you\nYou can take the darkness from the deep of the night\nAnd turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright\nI gotta follow it cause everything I know\nWell, it's nothing til I give it to you	2025-07-02 10:16:13.603106+00	410	4

758	I'll be walking the streets tonight\nJust trying to get it right\nIt's hard to see with so many around\nYou know I don't like being stuck in the crowd\nAnd the streets don't change but maybe their names\nI ain't got time for the game cause I need you ... this time	2025-07-02 10:16:13.889546+00	417	4
759	Intransigence is all around... military still in town\nArmour plated suits and ties... daddy just won't say goodbye\nReferee won't blow the whistle\nGod is good but will HE listen\nI'm nearly great\nBut there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free\nThough you never really belonged to me	2025-07-02 10:16:13.910201+00	365	4
760	If you can give it, I can take it\n'Cause if this heart is gonna break it's gonna take a lot to break it\nI know tonight, somebody's gonna win the fight\nSo if you're so tough, come on and prove it\nYour heart is down for the count and you know you're gonna lose it\nTonight you're gonna go down in flames\nJust like Jesse James	2025-07-02 10:16:13.935912+00	418	4
761	And for a moment I lose myself\nWrapped up in the pleasures of the world\nI've journeyed here and there and back again\nBut in the same old haunts I still find my friends\nMysteries not ready to reveal\nSympathies I'm ready to return\nI'll make the effort, love can last forever\nGraceful swans of never topple to the earth\nTomorrow's just an excuse\nAnd you can make it last, forever you\nYou can make it last, forever you	2025-07-02 10:16:13.959778+00	419	4

772	...and like a fool who will never see the truth\nI keep thinking something's gonna change\nThere's a danger in loving somebody too much\nAnd it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch\nThere's a reason why people don't stay who they are\nBaby sometimes love's just ain't enough	2025-07-02 10:16:14.194329+00	425	4

775	The sweetest song is silence that I've never heard\nFunny how your feet in dreams never touch the earth\nIn a wood full of princes, freedom is a kiss\nBut the prince hides his face\nFrom dreams in the mist\nThese dreams go on when I close my eyes\nEvery second of the night I live another life\nThese dreams that sleep when it's cold outside\nEvery moment I'm awake the further I'm away	2025-07-02 10:16:14.266273+00	427	4
5161	Sapere aude	2025-07-10 07:54:12.604007+00	622	13
776	And all the roads we have to walk are winding\nAnd all the lights that lead us there are blinding\nThere are many things that I would like to say to you\nBut I don't know how	2025-07-02 10:16:14.29023+00	428	4
777	Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road\nTime grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go\nSo make the best of this test, and don't ask why\nIt's not a question, but a lesson learned in time\nSo take the photographs, and still frames in your mind\nHang it on a shelf of good health and good time\nTattoos of memories and dead skin on trial\nFor what it's worth, it was worth all the while\nIt's something unpredictable, but in the end is right\nI hope you had the time of your life	2025-07-02 10:16:14.312809+00	429	4
778	Cos everytime I seem to fall in love\nCrash! Boom! Bang!\nI find the heart but then I hit the wall\nCrash! Boom! Bang!	2025-07-02 10:16:14.333636+00	396	4

780	It's the heart that's afraid of breaking that never learns to dance\nIt's the dream that's afraid of waking that never takes the chance\nIt's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give\nAnd the soul that's afraid of dying that never learns to live	2025-07-02 10:16:14.376486+00	\N	4
781	I remember when we could sleep on stones\nNow we lie together in whispers and moans\nWhen I was all messed up\nAnd I heard opera in my head\nYour love was a light bulb\nHanging over my bed\nBaby Baby Baby light my way	2025-07-02 10:16:14.39794+00	365	4
782	I wish I could just make you turn around, turn around and see me cry\nThere's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why\nYou're the only one who really knew me at all\nSo take a look at me now, 'cos there's just an empty space\nAnd there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face\nTake a look at me now, 'cos there's just an empty space\nAnd you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face	2025-07-02 10:16:14.422761+00	431	4
783	When you're standing in deep water\nAnd you're bailing yourself out with a straw\nAnd when you're drowning in deep water\nAnd you wake up making love to a wall\nWell it's these little time that help to remind\nIt's nothing without love, love, love	2025-07-02 10:16:14.442315+00	404	4
784	For they told you life is hard\nMisery from the start,\nIt's dull, it's slow, it's painful\nBut I tell you life is sweet\nIn spite of the misery\nThere's so much more, be grateful\nSo, who will you believe\nWho will you listen to\nWho will it be\n'Cause it's high time that you decide\nIt's time to make up your own\nYour own state of mind\nOh they told you life is long\nBe thankful when it's done\nDon't ask for more, be grateful\nBut I tell you life is short\nBe thankful because\nBefore you know it\nIt will be over\n'Cause life is sweet, life is also very short	2025-07-02 10:16:14.4673+00	432	4
785	We couldn't all be cowboys\nSo some of us are clowns\nI hope that everybody can find a little flame\nMe, I say my prayers and I just light myself on fire\nAnd I walk out on the wire once again	2025-07-02 10:16:14.485461+00	359	4
786	Chances thrown\nNothing's free\nLonging for what used to be\nStill it's hard\nHard to see\nFragile lives, shattered dreams	2025-07-02 10:16:14.507536+00	433	4
787	Who's gonna pick you up when you fall?\nWho's gonna hang it up when you call?\nWho's gonna pay attention to your dreams?\nWho's gonna plug your ears when you scream?\nYou can't go on think nothing's wrong\nWho's gonna drive you home tonight?	2025-07-02 10:16:14.528137+00	434	4
788	If you were an angel\nI would cut off your wings\nTo keep you with me.	2025-07-02 10:16:14.549259+00	435	4
789	I drive by the homeless sleeping on a cold dark street\nLike bodies in an open grave\nUnderneath the broken old neon sign\nThat used to read JESUS SAVES\nA mile away live the rich folks\nAnd I see how they're living it up\nWhile the poor they eat from hand to mouth\nThe rich is drinkin' from a golden cup\nAnd it just makes me wonder\nWhy so many lose, so few win\nSometimes I wish I didn't know now the things I didn't know then	2025-07-02 10:16:14.567341+00	368	4
790	We spin a world from cruel to kind\nAnd make our futures a downward slide\nThe strong get strong but still want more\nBut day by day, the giants thaw.\nTomorrow must be calling with an open door\nThere's no one left to start a revolution anymore\nWe need some flames\nTo burn down every door	2025-07-02 10:16:14.586878+00	380	4
791	Watch the early morning sun\nDrip like blood from the day\nSee the pretty people run\nSo many games to play\nSee the blue suburban dream\nUnder the jet plane sky\nSleep away and dream a dream\nLife is just a lullaby	2025-07-02 10:16:14.605254+00	351	4
792	Oh Jesse, paint you pictures, 'bout how it's gonna be.\nBy now I should know better, your dreams are never free.\nBut tell me all about, our little trailer by the sea.\nOh Jesse, you can always sell any dream to me.	2025-07-02 10:16:14.625433+00	436	4
793	I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,\nI know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky, but why\nWhy, why can't it be, why can't it be mine	2025-07-02 10:16:14.647387+00	437	4
794	Well, I am an idiot walking a tightrope of fortune and fame\nI am an acrobat swinging trapezes through circles of flame\nIf you've never stared off in the distance, then your life is a shame\nAnd though I'll never forget your face\nsometimes I can't remember my name	2025-07-02 10:16:14.665799+00	359	4
795	So you scream from behind your door, say what's mine is mine, and not yours\nI may have too much, but I'll take my chances\nCause God's stopped keeping score\nAnd you cling to the things they sold you\nDidn't you cover your eyes when they told you that he can't come back\nCause he has no children to come back for\nIt so hard to learn, there's so much to hate\nHanging on to hope when there is no hope to speak of\nAnd the wounded skies above say it's much too late\nSo maybe we should all be praying for time	2025-07-02 10:16:14.68934+00	438	4
796	So tired of this straight line, and everywhere you turn\nThere's vultures and thieves at your back\nThe storm keeps on twisting, you keep on building the lies\nThat you make up for all that you lack.\nIt don't make no difference, escaping one last time\nIt's easier to believe\nIn this sweet madness, oh this glorious sadness\nThat brings me to my knees.	2025-07-02 10:16:14.712346+00	439	4
797	A man is an island, but the water is deep\nAnd the shore on the other side is ragged and steep\nTo look for perfection is a lonely old ride\nIt takes a whole lot of courage and a whole lot of pride\nWhen you look for independence and you get what you want\nHow come you look back, thinking what have I done?\nBut time and again, it dawns on me\nIt's the price we pay for liberty\nI should have know, we all need a place to call home	2025-07-02 10:16:14.737883+00	440	4
798	Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice\nBut baby if you give me just one more try\nWe can pack up our old dreams and our old lives\nWe'll find a place where the sun still shines	2025-07-02 10:16:14.758279+00	358	4
799	There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill\nSo he found  himself a whore to love while daisies choked in the window sill.	2025-07-02 10:16:14.779124+00	404	4

801	Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken, your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you're wrong.\nCan you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance, five hour phone conversation, the best soy latte that you ever had... and me	2025-07-02 10:16:14.821078+00	441	4
802	I wish I was a girl so that you could believe me\nAnd I could shake this static everytime I try to sleep\nI wish for all the world that I could say\n'Hey Elizabeth, you know, I'm doing all right these days."\nBut I can't sleep at night.	2025-07-02 10:16:14.839239+00	359	4
803	And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you\nSomeone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to guide them along\nSo maybe I'll see you there\nWe can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares, and go\nDowntown, things'll be great when you're\nDowntown, don't wait a minute more\nDowntown, everything's waiting for you	2025-07-02 10:16:14.861558+00	442	4
804	With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil - that takes religion.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.620035+00	443	5
805	Morality is doing what is right, no matter what you are told. Religion is doing what you are told, no matter what is right.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.641445+00	444	5
806	If I could stop a person from raping a child, I would. Thats the difference between me and your God.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.662649+00	445	5
807	It is often easier to fight for ones principles than it is to live up to them.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.684004+00	446	5
808	Dracula: I love science. Science is the future, Agatha.\nAgatha: And yet you still fear the cross?\nDracula: 'Course I do. Everyone does, that's the problem. It's not a symbol of virtue and kindness. It's a mark of horror and oppression. Your idiot Church has terrorized the peasant population for centuries, and I have been imbibing the blood of those same persons for so long, I have absorbed their fear of the cross. My God. I can't wait to eat some atheists.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.700836+00	\N	5
809	Man is quite insane. He wouldn't know how to create a maggot, and he creates gods by the dozen.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.720428+00	447	5
810	I contend we are both atheists, I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.739358+00	448	5
811	"Respect for religion" has become a code phrase meaning "fear of religion". Religion, like all other ideas, deserve criticism, satire, and, yes, our fearless disrespect.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.759884+00	449	5
812	All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds, wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act on their dreams with open eyes, to make them possible.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.78029+00	450	5
813	We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.801425+00	451	5

815	I dont want to die any more than anyone else, and I think its a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for. Its the opposite. We have nothing to die for. We have everything to live for.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.880182+00	453	5
816	The logic of war seems to be if the belligerent can fight, he will fight. That leaders will not surrender until surrender is academic. How is a national leader to explain the sacrifice of so much for nothing?	2025-07-02 10:16:15.908153+00	454	5
817	Does it mean, if you dont understand something, and the community of physicists doesnt understand something, that means God did it? Is that how you want to play this game? Because if it is, heres a list of things in the past that the physicists at the time didnt understand. A talk show you might have conducted 200 years ago might have said, 'The planets do retrograde? Cant understand that, must be a god. And wed say, 'You know, youre right. And ten years later, we understand it. So if thats how you want to invoke your evidence for God, then God is an ever receding pocket of scientific ignorance that gets smaller and smaller and smaller as time goes on. So, just be ready for that to happen.	2025-07-02 10:16:15.941766+00	455	5

820	Heaven or Hell? You make it seem as if that's an easy choice to make. Sitting there in heaven watching others burn, and I can't do anything to help? That in itself would be hell for me. I'd be up there fighting god and his angels to let me out, so that I can come down and at least try to help. I am a moral person. Heaven is for uncaring Hypocrites.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.017838+00	456	5
821	If it's true that we are all from the center of a star, every atom in each of us from the center of a star, then we're all the same thing. Even a coke machine or a cigarette butt in the street in Buffalo, is made out of atoms that came from a star. They've all recycled thousands of times, as have you and I. And therefore, it's only me out there, so what is there to be afraid of? What is there that needs solace seeking? Nothing. There is nothing to be afraid of because it's all us. The trouble is we have been separated by being born and given a name and an identity and being individuated. We have been separated from the oneness and that's what religion exploits, that people have this yearning to be part of the overall one again. So they exploit that. They call it god and they say he has rules and I think that's cruel. I think you can do it absent religion.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.041544+00	457	5
822	In the way that scepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, there is a tendency to belittle, to condescend, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the sceptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them all the tools they need to pursue this great quest, let us temper our criticism with kindness. None of us comes fully equipped.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.060421+00	302	5
823	The idea that God could only forgive our sins by having his son tortured to death as a scapegoat is surely, from an objective point of view, a deeply unpleasant idea. If God wanted to forgive us our sins, why didn't he just forgive them? Why did he have to have his son tortured?	2025-07-02 10:16:16.078986+00	161	5

825	I hate to disappoint and take away the entertainment of it all but I am straight, not gay. It's disheartening to know such news on someone's personal life can be portrayed as fact with no viable source. This, to me, is an opportunity to expose our vulnerability to lies and manipulation through unprofessional and irresponsible news outlets, in which people consider TRUTH. Further, someone's sexual orientation should NEVER be big news, as it delivers a troubling message to children that they can't be themselves without fear of judgement. Race, creed, and sexual persuasion should not just be tolerated but understood and accepted. It's extremely disappointing that this topic would be used with the intention of being hurtful. We are near 2010... 2010! Yet race, sex and religion still play a major role in a hate-driven society. For the love of the future and humanity... let's wake up.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.125437+00	459	5

827	If you are offended by reading views that disagree with yours, then yes, you will be offended. However, it is not gratuitously offensive, it simply puts an argument, and if your views are strong enough, as I believe they are, you will be able to defend your views. You will not say, "Oh, it's offensive, it's offensive." You will say "No, you are wrong here and you are wrong here," and that's what you should do.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.167987+00	161	5
828	To criticise a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous but to criticise their religion, that is a right. That is a freedom. The freedom to criticise ideas, any ideas - even if they are sincerely held beliefs - is one of the fundamental freedoms of society. A law which attempts to say you can criticise and ridicule ideas as long as they are not religious ideas is a very peculiar law indeed.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.190122+00	461	5

830	Take some time and put the Bible on your summer reading list. Try and stick with it cover to cover. Not because it teaches history; we've shown you it doesn't. Read it because you'll see for yourself what the Bible is all about. It sure isn't great literature. If it were published as fiction, no reviewer would give it a passing grade. There are some vivid scenes and some quotable phrases, but there's no plot, no structure, there's a tremendous amount of filler, and the characters are painfully one-dimensional. Whatever you do, don't read the Bible for a moral code: it advocates prejudice, cruelty, superstition, and murder. Read it because: we need more atheists  and nothin' will get you there faster than readin' the damn Bible.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.229586+00	462	5
831	So my decision to sever my ties with the Southern Baptist Convention, after six decades, was painful and difficult. It was, however, an unavoidable decision when th e convention's leaders, quoting a few carefully selected Bible verses and claiming that Eve was created second to Adam and was responsible for original sin, ordained that women must be "subservient" to their husbands and prohibited from serving as deacons, pastors or chaplains in the military service. This was in conflict with my belief - confirmed in the holy scriptures - that we are all equal in the eyes of God.\nThe truth is that male religious leaders have had - and still have - an option to interpret holy teachings either to exalt or subjugate women. They have, for their own selfish ends, overwhelmingly chosen the latter.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.253791+00	463	5
832	I don't believe in Heaven and Hell. I don't know if I believe in God. All I know is that as as individual, I won't allow this life -- the only thing I know to exist -- to be wasted.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.276057+00	464	5

834	Not scorning the three delightful children who are everything to me and my only chance at even a glimpse at a second life, let alone an immortal one. Ill tell you something, if I was told to sacrifice them to prove my devotion to God, if I was told to do what all monotheists are told to do and admire the man who said, "Yes, Ill gut my kid to show my love of God." Id say "No, fuck you."	2025-07-02 10:16:16.32012+00	465	5

837	I dont have an issue with what you do in the church but Im going to be up in your face if youre going to knock on my science classroom and tell me I got to teach what youre teaching in your Sunday school. Thats when were going to fight Theres no tradition of scientists knocking down the Sunday school door, telling the preacher that might not necessarily be true. Thats never happened. There are no scientists picketing out front of churches. Theres been this coexistence forever, so to have religious communities knocking down the science door, theres something wrong there.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.409502+00	455	5
838	There is no god, and thats the simple truth. If every trace of any single religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created exactly that way again. There might be some other nonsense in its place, but not that exact nonsense. If all of science were wiped out, it would still be true and someone would find a way to figure it all out again.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.428458+00	462	5
839	It annoys me that the burden of proof is on us. It should be "You came up with the idea. Why do you believe it?" I could tell you I've got superpowers.

840	But who prays for Satan? Who in eighteen centuries, has had the common humanity to pray for the one sinner that needed it most, our one fellow and brother who most needed a friend yet had not a single one, the one sinner among us all who had the highest and clearest right to every Christian's daily and nightly prayers, for the plain and unassailable reason that his was the first and greatest need, he being among sinners the supremest?	2025-07-02 10:16:16.467957+00	72	5

858	But believing in something doesnt make it true. Hoping that something is true doesnt make it true. The existence of God is not subjective. He either exists or he doesnt. Its not a matter of opinion. You can have your own opinions. But you cant have your own facts.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.858166+00	453	5

841	... if God really did create the world, then all I can say is well done God, round of applause for God. But if he expects to be worshipped on the back of it, then I'm afraid he can go straight to hell, which is where I suspect he originated, if such a place exists, because the god of the Old Testament reads as if he's a auditioning for the role of Satan. It would be hard to imagine a more malevolent entity without the aid of a pair of comedy horns and a pitchfork.\nJust look at his track record. He comes out of the desert a few thousand years ago killing and smiting with righteous abandon, spawns three religions that absolutely loathe each other, supplies us with scriptures that set us at each other's throats like dogs over trifles, dividing us into us and them, into believers and infidels, ensuring that every one of us will be born with millions of instant enemies. Thanks to this monster, we live in a world divided against itself, where every one of us is an infidel to somebody, including you, no matter what you believe, even if it's nothing, you can be guaranteed that somebody somewhere hates your guts because of it. Welcome to planet earth, the centre of the universe. Enjoy your stay. Although apparently not enjoying it will get you into heaven that little bit quicker.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.494051+00	468	5
842	The very concept of blasphemy is a perfect illustration of the cowardly immaturity of the religious mind and the emptiness of religion itself. If religion contained any truth, it could be ridiculed, insulted, even defiled, without being diminished in any way. Its truth would shine through: undimmed, unblemished, shaming those who abused it into silence. But thats not how things are. Religion is prickly. Its intolerant. Its ultra-defensive precisely because its brittle and fragile. Its about as substantial as a meringue. Its all froth and no substance. Its had thousands of years to make its case and all its produced is sophistry, violence and a raft of morals that would shame a rattlesnake. And no amount of windbaggery and flim-flam from clergy can any longer disguise the simple bald fact that there is nothing there.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.514601+00	468	5
843	...only we don't call it 'ignorance', we call it 'faith'. What a horrible little word that is - faith - exuding as it does its fake aura of purity and virtue while fronting some of the ugliest ideas this planet has ever seen. Closing people's hearts when it should be opening them. Making them proud of things they should be ashamed of. And ashamed of things they should be proud of.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.536134+00	468	5
844	And I can see that everything about this God has been purposely designed to poison our experience of life on earth, not to enhance it, to keep us fearful, to suppress knowledge, to curtail freedom and creativity, and to celebrate death. It's nothing less than the sanctified dumbing-down of the human race. And demanding respect for it is frankly an insult that deserves to be repaid with considerable interest.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.556936+00	468	5
845	It doesn't have any effect on your life. What do you care?! People try to talk about it like it's a social issue. Like when you see someone stand up on a talk show and say, "How am I supposed to explain to my child that two men are getting married?"... I dunno, it's your shitty kid, you fuckin' tell 'em. Why is that anyone else's problem? Two guys are in love but they can't get married because you don't want to talk to your ugly child for fuckin' five minutes?	2025-07-02 10:16:16.580888+00	469	5
846	You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics look so petty. You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, "Look at that, you son of a bitch."	2025-07-02 10:16:16.603931+00	470	5
847	Show me a man or a woman alone and I'll show you a saint. Give me two and they'll fall in love. Give me three and they'll invent the charming thing we call 'society'. Give me four and they'll build a pyramid. Give me five and they'll make one an outcast. Give me six and they'll reinvent prejudice. Give me seven and in seven years they'll reinvent warfare. Man may have been made in the image of God, but human society was made in the image of His opposite number, and is always trying to get back home.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.625773+00	471	5
848	Naturally, the common people don't want war, but after all, it is the leaders of a country who determine the policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist  dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be bought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denouce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.646218+00	472	5
849	There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state; the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.667528+00	473	5
850	Atheism leaves a man to sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to reputation; all of which may be guides to an outward moral virtue, even if religion vanished; but religious superstition dismounts all these and erects an absolute monarchy in the minds of men.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.690136+00	474	5
851	You never see animals going through the absurd and often horrible fooleries of magic and religion ... Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat's meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.711172+00	475	5

853	To rebel against a powerful political, economic, religious, or social establishment is very dangerous and very few people do it, except, perhaps, as part of a mob. To rebel against the "scientific" establishment, however, is the easiest thing in the world, and anyone can do it and feel enormously brave, without risking as much as a hangnail. Thus, the vast majority, who believe in astrology and think that the planets have nothing better to do than form a code that will tell them whether tomorrow is a good day to close a business deal or not, become all the more excited and enthusiastic about the bilge when a group of astronomers denounces it.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.751228+00	226	5
854	Although the time of death is approaching me, I am not afraid of dying and going to Hell or (what would be considerably worse) going to the popularized version of Heaven. I expect death to be nothingness and, for removing me from all possible fears of death, I am thankful to atheism.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.771276+00	226	5
855	If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.791688+00	226	5
861	I do not believe in the God of theology who rewards good and punishes evil. My God created laws that take care of that. His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking, but by immutable laws.	2025-07-02 10:16:16.920776+00	104	5

866	Our belief is not a belief.  Our principles are not faith.  We do not rely solely upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason.  We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.We are not immune to the lure of wonder and mystery and awe: we have music and art and literature, and find that the serious ethical dilemmas are better handled by Shakespeare and Tolstoy and Schiller and Dostoyevsky and George Elliot than in the mythical morality tales of the holy books.  Literature, not scripture, sustains the mind and  since there is no other metaphor  also the soul.  We do not believe in heaven or hell, yet no statistic will ever find that without these blandishments and threats we commit more crimes of greed or violence than the faithful. (In fact, if a proper statistical inquiry could ever be made, I am sure the evidence would be the other way.)We are reconciled to living only once, except through our children, for whom we are perfectly happy to notice that we must make way, and room.  We speculate that it is at least possible that, once people accepted the fact of their short struggling lives, they might behave better toward each other and not worse.  We believe with certainty that an ethical life can be lived without religion.  And we know for a fact the corollary holds truethat religion has caused innumerable people to not just to conduct themselves no better than others, but to award themselves permission to behave in ways that would make a brothel-keeper or an ethnic cleanser raise an eyebrowThere is no need for us to gather every day, or every seven days, or on any high and auspicious day, to proclaim our rectitude or to grovel and wallow in our unworthiness.  We atheists do no require any priests, or any hierarchy above them, to police our doctrine.  Sacrifices and ceremonies are abhorrent to us, as are relics and the worship of any images or objects.  To us no spot on earth is or could be holier than another: to the ostentatious absurdity of the pilgrimage, or the plain horror of killing civilians in the name of some sacred wall or cave or shrine or rock, we can counterpose a leisurely or urgent walk from one side of the library or the gallery to another, or to lunch with an agreeable friend, in pursuit of truth or beauty.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.029888+00	465	5
867	The Aztecs had to tear open a human chest cavity every day just to make sure that the sun would rise.  Monotheists are supposed to pester their deity more times than that, perhaps, lest he be deaf.  How much vanity must be concealednot too effectively at thatin order to pretend that one is the personal object of a divine plan?  How much self respect must be sacrificed in order that one may squirm continually in an awareness of ones own sin?  How many needless assumptions must be made, and how much contortion is required, to receive every new insight of science and manipulate it so as to fit with the revealed words of ancient man-made deities?  How many saints and miracles and councils and conclaves are required in order first to be able to establish a dogma and thenafter infinite pain and loss and absurdity and crueltyto be forced to rescind one of those dogmas?  God did not create man in his own image.  Evidently, it was the other way about, which is the painless explanation for the profusion of gods and religions, and the fratricide both between and among faiths, that we see all about us and that has so retarded the development of civilization.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.050202+00	465	5

Our Blessed Virgin Mary of Most Precious Blood, menstrual, ephemeral, carnal, eternal. Rosa Mystica, Black Virgin of Rhinestone and Velvet Mystery, Madonna of Volcanoes and Violence, your eye burns through the palm of my outstretched hand. Eye glowing with heavenly flames, one single Eye watching over me, on earth as it is in heaven. Dammit, mother dear. There are serpents in your garden. Licking your ears with forked tongues, poisoning your already damaged heart. I am suffocated by my impotent rage, my eyes are blinded by cataracts blue as your miraculous robes, I listen intently for snatches of melody, the piercing high-pitched wail of your song of terror. Here, clues to your ghostly presence in the lingering trail of your deadly perfume: wild roses and plumeria, the dizzying fragrance of damas de noche, the rotting bouquets of wilted sampaguita flowers you cradle in your arms. I would curse you in Waray, Ilocano, Tagalog, Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Mandarin; I would curse you but I choose to love you instead. Amor, amas, amatis, amant, give us this day our daily bread. Our mother who art, what have those bastards gone and done now? Your eyes are veiled and clouded by tears, veiled but never blinded. Dazzle us with your pity, let the scars tattooed on your face be a reminder of your perennial sorrow. Kyrie eleison. Kyrie eleison. Lamb of goddammit who taketh away the sins of the world! My dim eyes scan the shadows in vain, Ave Maria full of grace. Ita missa est. Manila I was born here, Manila I will die here, tantum ergo sacramentum. So the daughters say, so the sons seek out miracles, so the men will not live to see the light. Your long monkey toes grip the hairy coconuts strewn at your feet, virgin with one ear pierced by a thorn. Stigmata of mercy, the blood of a slain rooster spouts from the open palms of your monkey hands, stigmata of beautiful suffering and insane endurance, Dolores dolorosa. Spilled blood of innocents, dead by the bullet, the dagger, the arrow; dead by the slingshot of polished stones, dead by grenades, hunger and thirst; dead by profound longing and profound despair; spilled blood of ignited flesh, exploded flesh, radiated flesh; spilled blood of forbidden knowledge, bless us, Mother, for we have sinned. Our Mother who art in heaven, forgive us our sins. Our Lady of Most Precious Blood, Wild Dogs, Hyenas, Jackals, Coyotes, and Wolves, Our Lady of Panthers and Jaguars, Our Lady of Cobras, Mournful Lizards, Lost Souls, and Radio Melodramas, give us this day; Our Lady of Typhoons, deliver us from evil, forgive us our sins but not theirs. Ave Maria, mother of revenge. The Lord was never with you. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed are the fruits of thy womb. guavas, mangos, santol, magosteen, durian.

Intelligent Design is a remarkably uncreative theory that abandons the search for understanding at the very point where it is most needed. If Intelligent Design is really a science, then the burden is on its scientists to discover the mechanisms used by the Intelligent Designer. And if those mechanisms turn out to be natural forces, then no supernatural force is necessary, and they can simply change their name to evolutionary scientists and get to work.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.157081+00	483	5
873	War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. The person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.177762+00	484	5
874	My constellation reclines in its den in heaven; some men call me the Great Bear, but others the Offspring of a Dragon. Moreover, a smaller constellation accompanies my constellation, for the high position and throne of my father is always in the sky. So do not ask me so many things, Solomon, for eventually your kingdom will be divided. This glory of yours is temporary. You have us to torture for a little while; then we shall disperse among human beings again with the result that we shall be worshipped as gods because men do not know the names of the angels who rule over us.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.193539+00	\N	5

Fuck the revolution! They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution. What's the glory in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children? Where's the glory in that? Where's the glory in bombing a Rememberance Day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day? Where's the glory in that? To leave them dying, a cripple for life; or dead, under the rubble of a revolution that the majority of the people in my country don't want. No more.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.742672+00	213	5

905	SIMON: You asked a question, sir. Let me answer it. The genius of the constitution is that it can always be changed. The genius of the constitution is that it makes no permanent rule other than its faith in the wisdom of ordinary people to govern themselves.\nMR. PICANNON: The faith in the wisdom of ordinary people is exactly what makes the Consitution incomplete and crude.\nSIMON: Crude? No, sir. Our founding parents were pompous middle-aged white farmers, but they were also great men, because they knew one thing that all great men should know: that they didn't know everything. They knew they were going to make mistakes, but they made sure to leave a way to correct them. They didn't think of themselves as leaders. They wasted a government of citizens, not royalty. A government of listeners, not lecturers. A government that could change, not stand still. The president isn't an elected king, no matter how many bombs he can drop, because the crude Constitution doesn't trust him. He's a servant of the people. He's a bum. Ok, Mr. Picannon? He's just a bum. The only bliss that he's searching for is freedom and justice.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.867376+00	505	5

I quickly realised that, just the "saying" of these texts wasn't "praying", but that there had to be more to do with it, and I didn't know what. I stopped thinking about it. Millions of hale mary's I've recited, but not one did I "pray". "Praying helps you get at ease," my grandmother said. I get at ease by watching the flames in an open fire. That "praying", just like staring into the flames, serves no purpose and leads to nothing, now is a part of my "knowledge of life", a heritage of my years in the Tjideng prisoner camp.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.931968+00	508	5

911	Orders shouted in an unknown, guttural tongue rose to the windows of the seemingly dead, deserted houses; while behind the fast-closed shutters eager eyes peered forth at the victors-masters now of the city, its fortunes, and its lives, by "right of war." The inhabitants, in their darkened rooms, were possessed by that terror which follows in the wake of cataclysms, of deadly upheavals of the earth, against which all human skill and strength are vain. For the same thing happens whenever the established order of things is upset, when security no longer exists, when all those rights usually protected by the law of man or of Nature are at the mercy of unreasoning, savage force. The earthquake crushing a whole nation under falling roofs; the flood let loose, and engulfing in its swirling depths the corpses of drowned peasants, along with dead oxen and beams torn from shattered houses; or the army, covered with glory, murdering those who defend themselves, making prisoners of the rest, pillaging in the name of the Sword, and giving thanks to God to the thunder of cannon--all these are appalling scourges, which destroy all belief in eternal justice, all that confidence we have been taught to feel in the protection of Heaven and the reason of man.	2025-07-02 10:16:17.997338+00	511	5

Everybody counteracts what God is really about. If Jesus was here, do you think Jesus would show me any love? Do you think Jesus would love me? I'm a Muslim, but do you think Jesus would love me... I think Jesus would have a drink with me and discuss... why you acting like that? Now, he would be cool. He would talk to me. No Christian ever did that and said in the name of Jesus even... They'd throw me in jail and write bad articles about me and then go to church on Sunday and say Jesus is a wonderful man and he's coming back to save us. But they don't understand that when he comes back, that these crazy greedy capitalistic men are gonna kill him again.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.23997+00	520	5

923	Life, like some grand mosaic slowly loses hold over time, and the fragile strands that connect the many different parts unravels. The universe is a mirror, fragile and reflective, and we all stand in awe of our own human vanity. Fools see the universe as linear, absolute, all knowing. The wise see the universe as chaotic, unknown, fragile. Only on the verge of infinity can one see the fall apart universe. Sadness is knowing that we all stand upon a universe with a cracked glass bottom, and in an instant we may all sink into oblivion. Everything falls apart. Empires rise and crumble as tin soldiers hold plastic banners of righteous intent, all soaked with the blood of innocents. Hands raise and fall to the deafening sound of a million questions all unanswered. Love is just another unfelt emotion, talked about but never seen in full bloom. Love is only rumor and hearsay in the fall apart universe. Eventually we all must stand upon the jagged glass of the broken boundaries and broken promises. We must all suffer the soul bleeding that follows as the tattered splinters dig deep.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.264435+00	521	5

944	The Humanist says he does not believe in God because the supposed God behaves in a morally arbitrary way: allowing innocents to die, scoundrels to live, some to have wealth, others to be poor, some to be in pain, and others to be healthy. This, they say, is morally arbitrary, and does not fit with how they think a "real" God would behave. Then THEY get to play God, by deciding on the fate of the unborn child: will they let it live or kill it. This, they insist, is their moral "right".

947	It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.742662+00	530	5
948	Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.761381+00	64	5
949	To exercise power costs effort and demands courage. That is why so many fail to assert rights to which they are perfectly entitled - because a right is a kind of power but they are too lazy or too cowardly to exercise it. The virtues which cloak these faults are called patience and forbearance.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.778788+00	55	5
950	Self-denial is the shining sore on the leprous body of Christianity.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.794501+00	55	5
951	Pure truth, like pure gold, has been found unfit for circulation because men have discovered that it is far more convenient to adulterate the truth than to refine themselves.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.815335+00	531	5
952	All religions are founded on the fear of the many and the cleverness of the few.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.835783+00	532	5
989	Life is not lost by dying; life is lost minute by minute, day by dragging day, in all the thousand small uncaring ways.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.592953+00	555	5
954	Do not fear your enemies. The worst they can do is kill you. Do not fear friends. At worst, they may betray you. Fear those who do not care; they neither kill nor betray, but betrayal and murder exists because of their silent consent.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.872683+00	533	5
955	Heav'n hath no rage like love to hatred turn'd, nor Hell a fury, like a woman scorn'd.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.896143+00	534	5
956	People reduced to the extremity of need are also driven to the utmost limits of their resources, and woe to any defenseless person who comes in their way. Work and wages, food and warmth, courage and goodwill - all is lost to them. The daylight dwindles into shadow and darkness enters their hearts; and within this darkness man seizes upon the weakness of woman and child and forces them into ignominy. No horror is then excluded. Desperation is bounded only by the flimsiest of walls, all giving access to vice and crime... they appear utterly depraved, corrupt, vile and odious; but it is rare for those who have sunk so low not to be degraded in the process, and there comes a point, moreover, where the unfortunate and infamous are grouped together, merged in a single fateful world. They are Les Miserables - the outcasts, the underdogs.	2025-07-02 10:16:18.913451+00	85	5
957	O thou ungrateful, faithless wretch! You were afraid of being united to someone who adored you. These bonds of an everlasting chain were becoming a burden to you, and your heart, which is seduced by fickleness and frivolity alone, was not discerning or sensitive enough to be conscious of all the charms such bonds entailed. Twas the thought of leaving Paris that frightened you; my love was not enough for you; I was unable to make it last. Die, monster, born to make my life miserable, stay there in Paris forever! May it one day become, through the deceitfulness and knavery of the scoundrel who will replace me in your heart, as odious to you as your own double dealing has made it in my eyes!	2025-07-02 10:16:18.935576+00	535	5

964	Genocide is like a dessert. It is made of the flesh and bones of woman and children, it is sweetened with the blood of the innocent, and it is baked in the ovens of Auschwitz.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.07032+00	\N	5
965	There were truths to be learnt and there was wisdom to be gained... but there was a price to to be paid as well. You could not brush up against the future and escape unscathed. You could not see into the forbidden and avoid damage to your sight.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.092636+00	540	5

967	Ignorance and prejudice are the ballast of our ship of state - however, ships without ballast are not seaworthy and cannot sail in the tempests, nor reach a safe harbor.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.124439+00	\N	5

971	I listen to money singing, it's like looking down from long French windows at a provincial town. The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad in the evening sun. It is intensely sad...	2025-07-02 10:16:19.223437+00	543	5
972	The Christian view that all intercourse outside marriage is immoral was, as we see in the above passages from St. Paul, based upon the view that all sexual intercourse, even within marriage, is regrettable. A view of this sort, which goes against biological facts, can only be regarded by sane people as a morbid aberration. The fact that it is embedded in Christian ethics has made Christianity throughout its whole history a force tending towards mental disorders and unwholesome views of life.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.241697+00	458	5
973	Lust is the cause of generation\nAppetite is the support of life\nFear or timidity is the prolongation of life, and\nFraud the preservation of its instruments.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.264268+00	544	5
974	One, with God, is always a majority, but many a martyr has been burned at the stake while the votes were being counted.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.285561+00	545	5

979	Modern capitalism, organising the reduction of all social life to a spectacle, cannot offer any other spectacle than that of our own alienation.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.381318+00	547	5

981	As the fly bangs against the window attempting freedom while the door stands open, so we bang against death ignoring heaven.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.424084+00	549	5
982	It is impossible to defend perfectly against the attack of those who want to die.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.451586+00	\N	5
983	Christianity has not been tried and found wanting; it has been found difficult and not tried.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.472655+00	551	5
984	The hands that help are better far than the lips that pray.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.493019+00	552	5
985	I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, petty - I call it the one mortal blemish of mankind.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.510167+00	64	5
986	In Christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.528107+00	64	5
987	A Christian is a man who feels repentance on Sunday for what he did on Saturday and is going to do on Monday.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.550143+00	553	5
988	Die? I should say not, dear fellow. No Barrymore would allow such a conventional thing to happen to him.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.572349+00	554	5
991	The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.632912+00	223	5
992	If we catch a glimpse of freedom, we wish to possess it; if we catch a glimpse of death, we want nothing to do with it. One we cannot have, the other we cannot avoid.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.653324+00	557	5

995	Education is the process of driving a set of prejudices down your throat.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.709859+00	559	5
996	The shepherd drives the wolf from the sheep's throat, for which the sheep thanks the shepherd as his liberator, while the wolf denounces him for the same act as the destroyer of liberty.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.727181+00	306	5
997	The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.742689+00	\N	5

1003	Laws are only words words written on paper, words that change on society's whim and are interpreted differently daily by politicians, lawyers, judges, and policemen. Anyone who believes that all laws should always be obeyed would have made a fine slave catcher. Anyone who believes that all laws are applied equally, despite race, religion, or economic status, is a fool.	2025-07-02 10:16:19.857472+00	561	5

1011	None deserve praise for being good who have not the spirit to be bad: goodness, for the most part, is nothing but indolence or weakness of will.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.018442+00	566	5
1012	The world is a mirror of infinite beauty, yet no man sees it. It is a Temple of Majesty, yet no man regards it. It is a region of Light and Peace, did not men disquiet it. It is the Paradise of God.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.039771+00	567	5
1013	You're obliged to pretend respect for people and institutions you think absurd. You live attached in a cowardly fashion to moral and social conventions you despise, condemn, and know lack all foundation. It is that permanent contradiction between your ideas and desires and all the dead formalities and vain pretenses of your civilization which makes you sad, troubled and unbalanced. In that intolerable conflict you lose all joy of life and all feeling of personality, because at every moment they supress and restrain and check the free play of your powers. That's the poisoned and mortal wound of the civilized world.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.064254+00	568	5
1014	It is easy to shield the outer body from poisoned arrows, but it is impossible to shield the mind from the poisoned darts that originate within itself. Greed, anger, foolishness and the infatuations of egoism - these four poisoned darts originate within the mind and infect it with deadly poison.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.082602+00	\N	5
1015	In a universe suddenly divested of illusion and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.104108+00	569	5

1023	Religion has done love a great service by making it a sin.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.271271+00	574	5
1024	Freethinkers reject faith as a valid tool of knowledge. Faith is the opposite of reason because reason imposes very strict limits on what can be true, and faith has no limits at all. A Great Escape into faith is no retreat to safety. It is nothing less than surrender.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.292411+00	575	5

1027	What happens when the same number of people pray for something as pray against it? How does God decide whose prayer to answer? Does the total number of people praying for or against something matter? How about the righteousness of the supplicants? Are positive prayers answered more frequently than negative ones? Does God take the positive ones and Satan the negative? Does the intensity of the praying have any effect on the outcome? Does the length of time one devotes to praying have any effect on the frequency with which one's prayers are answered? Do the words and phrases used in the prayer - either positive or negative - have any bearing on the success rate? Does the nature of the thing or things prayed for have any bearing on the prayer's success rate - either positive or negative prayers? Why or why not??	2025-07-02 10:16:20.350564+00	576	5

1033	As Christians try to force prayer into public schools, they often settle for a 'moment of silence.' But that supposedly innocuous 'moment of silence' is a deafening roar to a nonbeliever.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.475497+00	581	5

1041	I have lived nearly fifty years, and I have seen life as it is. Pain, misery, hunger... cruelty beyond belief. I have heard the singing from taverns and the moans from bundles of filth on the streets. I have been a soldier and seen my comrades fall in battle... or die more slowly under the lash in Africa. I have held them in my arms at the final moment. These were men who saw life as it is, yet they died despairing. No glory, no gallant last words... only their eyes filled with confusion, whimpering the question: "Why?" I do not think they asked why they were dying, but why they had lived. When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams - this may be madness. To seek treasure where there is only trash. Too much sanity may be madness. And maddest of all, to see life as it is and not as it should be.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.671795+00	584	5

1043	People whose history and future were threatened each day by extinction considered that it was only by divine intervention that they were able to live at all. I find it interesting that the meanest life, the poorest existence, is attributed to God's will, but as human beings become more affluent, as their living standards and style begin to ascend the material scale, God descends the scale of responsibility at a commensurate speed.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.740657+00	586	5
1044	Religion is the opium of the masses.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.769733+00	587	5
1045	They are deceived who flatter themselves that the ignorant and debased slave has no conception of the magnitude of his wrongs. They are deceived who imagine that he arises from his knees with back lacerated and bleeding, cherishing only a spirit of meekness and forgiveness. A day may come - it will, if his prayer is heard. A terrible day of vengeance when the master in his turn will cry in vain for mercy.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.793963+00	588	5
1046	Twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question, now, what had happned to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again: but already it was impossible to say which was which.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.814882+00	116	5

1049	Some asked me the meaning of life once, I once thought I knew it but my answer got clouded by life.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.884305+00	590	5

1052	If a faithful account was rendered of Man's ideas upon divinity, he would be obliged to acknowledge that for the most part the word "Gods" has been used to express the concealed, remote, unknown causes of the effects he witnessed; that he applies this term when the spring of the natural, the source of known causes, ceases to be visible; As soon as he loses the thread of these causes, or as soon as his mind can no longer follow the chain, he solves the difficulty, terminates his research, by ascribing it to his Gods... When, therefore, he ascribes to his gods the production of some phenomenon... Does he, in fact, do anything more than substitute for the darkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has ben accustomed to listen with reverential awe?	2025-07-02 10:16:20.947539+00	592	5
1053	Either god should have written a book to fit my brain, or he should have made my brain to fit his book.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.966028+00	552	5
1054	In fear of death we all try to beat time, to outrun it with doctors and technology. But the reality of it all is that there is only one place where time has no meaning and the predator has not teeth. The irony is that place is heaven and the only way to get there is to die. We actually fear what we want most, Death.	2025-07-02 10:16:20.986752+00	593	5

1067	A Christian anarchist has no business belonging to such a reactionary organization [the Catholic Church]. I do not believe in original sin, indulgences, the infallibility of the pope, or obedience to any church official if it is against my conscience.

1077	Faith is a cop-out. It is intellectual bankruptcy. If the only way you can accept an assertion is by faith, then you are conceding that it can't be taken on its own merits.	2025-07-02 10:16:21.459778+00	575	5

1087	The furies are at home in the mirror; it is their address. Even the clearest water, if deep enough can drown. Never think to surprise them. Your face approaching ever so friendly is the white flag they ignore. There is no truce with the furies. A mirror's temperature is always zero. It is ice in the veins. It's camera is an x-ray. It is a chalice held out to you in silent communion, where gaspingly you partake of a shifting identity never your own.	2025-07-02 10:16:21.675729+00	\N	5

1089	Athiests don't believe in God nor an afterlife. But Believers do believe in God and an afterlife. And what's interesting to think about is that if Athiests are right, then they'll never know it. If they are wrong, then they will regret it. Believers will never know if they are wrong, but, if they are right, then they will be happy.	2025-07-02 10:16:21.719073+00	614	5

1095	When childhood dies, its corpses are called adults and they enter society, one of the politer names of hell. That is why we dread children, even if we love them, they show us the state of our decay.	2025-07-02 10:16:21.848669+00	619	5

1115	The flapping of a single butterfly's wing today produces a tiny change in the state of the atmosphere. Over a period of time, what the atmosphere actually does diverges from what it would have done. So, in a month's time, a tornado that would have devastated the Indonesian coast doesn't happen.

1119	A political convention is after all not a meeting of a corporation's board of directors; it is a fiesta, a carnival, a pig-rooting, horse-snorting, band-playing, voice-screaming medieval get-together of greed, practical lust, compromised idealism, career-advancement, meeting, feud, vendetta, conciliation, of rabble-rousers, fist fights (as it used to be), embraces, drunks (again as it used to be) and collective rivers of animal sweat.	2025-07-02 10:16:22.362665+00	633	5

1129	"Judge not, that ye be not judge"... is an abdication of moral responsibility: it is a moral blank check one gives to others in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself. There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so long as men have to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; so long as moral values are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. To abstain from condemning a torturer, is to become an accesory to the torture and murder of his victims. The moral principle to adopt... is: "Judge, and be prepared to be judged."	2025-07-02 10:16:22.589987+00	135	5

1136	Those who look for the laws of nature as a support for their new works collaborate with the creator.	2025-07-02 10:16:22.740532+00	642	5

1138	A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear and punishment and hope of reward after death.

1141	Beyond a critical point within a finite space, freedom diminishes as numbers increase... the human question is not how many can possibly survive within the system, but what kind of existence is possible for those who do survive.	2025-07-02 10:16:22.844466+00	644	5

1147	Christianity has done its utmost to close the circle and declared even doubt to be sin. One is supposed to be cast into belief without reason, by a miracle, and from then on to swim in it as in the brightest and least ambiguous of elements: even a glance towards land, even the thought that one perhaps exists for something else as well as swimming, even the slightest impulse of our amphibious nature - is sin! And notice that all this means that the foundation of belief and all reflection on its origin is likewise excluded as sinful. What is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned.	2025-07-02 10:16:22.983046+00	64	5

1156	Thoughts are the gun, words are the bullets, deeds are the target, the bulls-eye is heaven.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.160532+00	549	5
1157	While seeking revenge, dig two graves - one for yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.181213+00	549	5
1158	A storm is coming; our storm. Emperor - we come for you!	2025-07-02 10:16:23.205126+00	648	5
1159	What I give form to in daylight is only one per cent of what I have seen in darkness.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.232873+00	649	5
1160	Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.26034+00	458	5
1161	Men talk of killing time, while time quietly kills them.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.294886+00	650	5
1162	Those who climb soap boxes to preach "tolerance" of all "lifestyles" are typically the most intolerant of all. It is easy enough to prove: simply tell such preachers of intolerance that you have an opposite opinion.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.318583+00	\N	5
1163	Pleasant it is to behold great encounters of warfare arrayed over the plains, with no part of yours in peril.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.345991+00	651	5
1164	To kill someone, even treacherously is more manly than to wound a friend by betraying his confidence.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.371364+00	652	5
1165	Who knows whether, If I had given up smoking, I should really have become the strong perfect man I imagined? Perhaps it was this very doubt that bound me to my vice, because life is so much pleasanter if one is able to believe in one's own latent greatness.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.399714+00	652	5
1166	Tears throw a veil over our faults and allow us to accuse fate without fear or contradiction.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.423433+00	652	5
1167	Everyone remembers his past with greater vividness as the present becomes more important. Dying men in their last delirium are supposed to see their whole life spread out before them.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.446745+00	652	5
1168	And it is true that life lacks the monotony of museums. There come days which seem worthy of being framed, but they are so full of conflicting sounds, of line and color and living, burning light that they never become tedious.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.467497+00	652	5
1169	If some books are deemed most baneful and their sale forbid, how then with deadlier facts, not dreams of doting men? Those whom books will hurt will not be proof against events. Events, not books should be forbid.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.493542+00	653	5
1170	History is a pack of lies about events that never happened told by people who weren't there.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.511207+00	167	5
1171	If you're goin' to be a bear... be a grizzly!	2025-07-02 10:16:23.53307+00	654	5
1172	There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.552237+00	180	5
1173	How can I write moral novels? I didn't find heroic people around me.\nHow can I write about beautiful things? I have no reference point.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.577095+00	655	5
1174	The human mind treats a new idea the way the body treats a strange protein - it rejects it.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.601397+00	656	5
1175	If a young man is to get through puberty gracefully, he must first destroy his conscience.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.621009+00	\N	5
1176	I kept on digging the hole deeper and deeper looking for the treasure chest until I finally lifted my head, looked up and realised that I had dug my own grave.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.645756+00	657	5
1177	The politer the society, the greater the lies it requires.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.670241+00	658	5

1179	Some people will not tolerate such emotional honesty in communication. They would rather defend their dishonesty on the grounds that it might hurt others. Therefore, having rationalized their phoniness into nobility, they settle for superficial relationships.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.711849+00	\N	5
1180	We come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!\nWe come, we come with horn of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!\nTo Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;\nThough Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;\nFor bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars - we go to war!\nTo land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;\nTo Isengard with doom we come!\nWith doom we come, with doom we come!	2025-07-02 10:16:23.732444+00	509	5

1384	Losing an illusion makes you wiser than finding a truth.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.205656+00	750	5
1182	Prisons are built with stones of Law,\nBrothels with bricks of Religion.\nThe pride of the peacock is the glory of God.\nThe lust of the goat is the bounty of God.\nThe wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.\nThe nakedness of woman is the work of God.\nExcess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.\nThe roaring of lions, the howling of wolves,\nthe raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword,\nare portions of eternity too great for the eye of man.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.779019+00	277	5
1183	The attempt to silence a man is the greatest honor you can bestow on him. It means that you recognize his superiority to yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.802727+00	661	5
1184	Hypocrisy is the most difficult and nerve-racking vice that any man can pursue; it needs an unceasing vigilance and a rare detachment of spirit. It cannot, like adultery or gluttony, be practiced at spare moments; it is a whole-time job.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.821169+00	562	5
1185	History repeats itself because nobody listens.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.837611+00	\N	5

1188	Saints should always be judged guilty until proven innocent.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.898276+00	116	5
1189	It is better to have a lion at the head of an army of sheep, than a sheep at the head of an army of lions.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.920345+00	663	5
1190	A chief is a man who assumes responsibility. He says, "I was beaten"; he does not say, "My men were beaten."	2025-07-02 10:16:23.944338+00	664	5
1191	A transition from an author's book to his conversation is too often like an entrance into a large city, after a distant prospect. Remotely, we see nothing but spires of temples and turrets of palaces, and imagine it the residence of splendour, grandeur, and magnificence; but when we have passed the gates, we find it perplexed with narrow passages, disgraced with despicable cottages, embarrassed with obstructions, and clouded with smoke.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.963953+00	231	5
1192	It is as true to say that God is permanent and the World fluent, as that the World is permanent and God is fluent.\nIt is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many.\nIt is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently , as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently.\nIt is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the World.\nIt is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God.\nIt is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God.	2025-07-02 10:16:23.988574+00	665	5
1193	God does not think; he creates. He does not exist; he is eternal.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.010891+00	666	5
1194	The primary question about life after death is not whether it is a fact, but even if it is, what problems that really solves.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.033071+00	667	5
1195	Faith is believing something you know ain't true.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.050597+00	72	5
1196	We should be agnostic about those things for which there is no evidence. We should not hold beliefs merely because they gratify our desires for afterlife, immortality, heaven, hell, etc.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.072695+00	668	5
1197	Has this world been so kind to you that you should leave with regret? There are better things ahead than any we leave behind.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.093173+00	140	5
1198	The essence of wisdom is to remain suspicious of what you want to be true.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.117529+00	669	5
1199	Never, never pin your whole faith on any human being: not if he is the best and wisest in the whole world. There are lots of nice things you can do with sand; but do not try building a house on it.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.14814+00	140	5
1200	A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship Him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling the word, 'darkness' on the walls of his cell.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.177365+00	140	5
1201	There comes a moment when people who have been dabbling in religion ('man's search for God'!) suddenly draw back. Supposing we really found Him? We never meant it to come to that! Worse still, supposing He had found us?	2025-07-02 10:16:24.206221+00	140	5
1202	If you love God, burn the church.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.235233+00	670	5
1203	I have said I have met Satan, and this is true. But it is not tangible. It no more has horns, hooves and a forked tail than God has a long white beard.  Even the name, Satan, is just a name we have given to something basically nameless.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.263007+00	671	5
1204	I have a dream today.\nI have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.\nThis is our hope. This is the faith with which I return to the South. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.289075+00	672	5
1205	He that increases knowledge increaseth sorrow.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.307369+00	\N	5
1206	An apology for the devil: it must be remembered that we have only heard one side of the case. God has written all the books.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.334219+00	673	5
1207	We may not pay Satan reverence, for that would be indiscreet, but we can at least respect his talents.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.361132+00	72	5
1208	To die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. Death of one's own free choice, death at the proper time, with a clear head and with joyfulness, consummated in the midst of children and witnesses: so that an actual leave-taking is possible while he who is leaving is still there.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.390287+00	64	5
1209	It's better to burn out than fade away.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.42203+00	674	5
1210	Hollywood and Disneyland are the legacy of Europe's cultural imperialism. We gave them nursery rhymes and they gave back film. Televised riots are as American as Barbie/ Big Macs. Tomorrow the riots will be forgotten but Mickey mouse will still be there. Welcome to Disneyland.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.447834+00	675	5
1211	He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster... when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.467042+00	64	5
1212	Wer mit Ungeheuern kampft, mag zusehn,\nda├ƒ er nicht dabei zum Ungeheuer wird.\nUnd wenn du lange in einen Abgrund blickst,\nblickt der Abgrund auch in dich hinein.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.485449+00	64	5
1213	War is war. The only good human being is a dead one.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.504659+00	116	5
1346	If you were taught that elves caused rain, every time it rained, you'd see the proof of elves.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.386361+00	732	5
1214	Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.523355+00	116	5
1215	I was lied to when I was told life was fair, that someone would always be there, people cared about how I felt, I was unhappy with the cards I was dealt. When I was a child, my castle was my home, now I'm walking empty streets, memories and me alone. More's been said in silence than can ever be spoken in words. Secrets shared, and promises kept, and feeling they'll never return.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.549125+00	676	5
1216	The better the state is established, the fainter is humanity. To make the individual uncomfortable, that is my task.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.568585+00	64	5
1217	All truth is simple... is that not doubly a lie?	2025-07-02 10:16:24.588345+00	64	5
1218	But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.608515+00	116	5
1219	I do not pretend to be able to prove that there is no God. I equally cannot prove that Satan is a fiction. The Christian god may exist;  so may the gods of Olympus, or of ancient Egypt, or of Babylon. But no one of these hypotheses is more probable than any other: they lie outside the region of even probable knowledge, and therefore there is no reason to consider any of them.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.628462+00	458	5
1220	A Roman Catholic worships a god who speaks through the Pope, while a Baptist worships a god who does not.  They cannot be worshipping the same god.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.647727+00	581	5
1221	If a plane crashes and 99 people die while 1 survives, it is called a miracle. Should the families of the 99 think so?	2025-07-02 10:16:24.668603+00	581	5
1222	Life can be beautiful, profound, and awe-inspiring, even without an irate god threatening us with eternal torment.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.688605+00	581	5
1223	We are not accountable for the sins of "Adam".	2025-07-02 10:16:24.707474+00	552	5
1224	Martyrs have been sincere. And so have tyrants. Wise men have been sincere. And so have fools.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.73174+00	677	5
1225	If there is a God, atheism must strike Him as less of an insult than religion.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.754082+00	678	5
1226	Eskimo: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?"\nPriest: "No, not if you did not know."\nEskimo: "Then why did you tell me?"	2025-07-02 10:16:24.772202+00	\N	5
1227	There was a time when religion ruled the world. It is known as the Dark Ages.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.795966+00	679	5
1228	Faith in God necessarily implies a lack of faith in humanity.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.818841+00	680	5
1229	One final snag in the "Bible only" view is this: the Bible itself teaches that moral truths are revealed outside the Scriptures.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.837867+00	610	5
1230	It ain't the parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.859203+00	72	5
1231	Don't unlock doors you're not prepared to go through.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.878145+00	\N	5
1232	If you have the arrogance of a god and can kill like a god, who's to say you are not a god?	2025-07-02 10:16:24.896961+00	\N	5
1233	Hell lives a life of its own, losing itself never from its existence, loving those whom it hurts, hurting those whom it loves.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.91499+00	\N	5
1234	Why does man not see things? He is himself standing in the way: he conceals things.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.932847+00	64	5
1235	What is new, however, is always evil, being that which wants to conquer and overthrow the old boundary markers and the old pieties; and only what is old is good. The good men are in all ages those who dig the old thoughts, digging deep and getting them to bear fruit - the farmers of the spirit. But eventually all land is depleted, and the ploughshare of evil must come again and again.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.95398+00	64	5
1236	We cannot tempt fate without eventually getting scorched by it.	2025-07-02 10:16:24.980924+00	681	5
1237	If a man hasn't discovered something that he will die for, he isn't fit to live.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.002677+00	672	5
1238	Cast your whole vote, not a piece of paper merely, but your whole influence. A minority is powerless when it conforms to a majority; but is irresistable when it clogs by its whole weight. If the alternative is to keep all just men in prison, or give up war and slavery, the State will not hesitate which to choose.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.027172+00	95	5
1239	This is my simple religion. There is no need for temples; no need for complicated philosophy. Our own brain, our own heart is our temple; the philosophy is kindness.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.054308+00	682	5
1240	The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.078938+00	64	5
1241	I always turn to the sports pages first, which records people's accomplishments. The front page has nothing but man's failures.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.105399+00	683	5
1242	Whatever you do, you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong. There are always difficulties arising that tempt you to believe your critics are right. To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage that a soldier needs. Peace has its victories, but it takes brave men and women to win them.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.127602+00	141	5
1243	The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.147544+00	275	5
1244	Religion is the masterpiece of the art of animal training, for it trains people as to how they shall think.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.1707+00	684	5
1245	Religion is a candle inside a multicolored lantern. Everyone looks through a particular color, but the candle is always there.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.194921+00	685	5
1246	Liberty is the possibility of doubting, the possibility of making a mistake, the possibility of searching and experimenting, the possibility of saying No to any authority - literary, artistic, philosophic, religious, social and even political.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.217793+00	686	5
1247	Freedom of speech and freedom of action are meaningless without freedom to think. And there is no freedom of thought without doubt.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.240247+00	687	5
1248	Hope, like faith, is nothing if it is not courageous; it is nothing if it is not ridiculous.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.262938+00	688	5
1249	In a time of drastic change it is the learners who inherit the future. The learned usually find themselves equipped to live in a world that no longer exists.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.285313+00	689	5
1250	Remember, always give your best. Never get discouraged. Never be petty. Always remember, others may hate you. But those who hate you don't win unless you hate them. And then you destroy yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.309374+00	690	5
1251	Doubt is part of all religion. All the religious thinkers were doubters.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.332653+00	691	5
1252	All of us who are concerned for peace and triumph of reason and justice must be keenly aware how small an influence reason and honest good will exert upon events in the political field.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.352332+00	104	5
1253	Human beings are perhaps never more frightening than when they are convinced beyond doubt that they are right.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.377426+00	692	5
1254	Obstacles cannot crush me. Every obstacle yields to stern resolve. He who is fixed to a star does not change his mind.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.397069+00	544	5

1256	I desire to go to Hell, not to Heaven. In Hell I shall enjoy the company of popes, kings and princes, but in Heaven are only beggars, monks, hermits and apostles.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.435476+00	180	5

1258	Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than going to a garage makes you an automobile.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.483743+00	694	5

1262	...finally men were saved only through God's son dying for them, and that unless human beings believed this silly, impossible and wicked story they were doomed to hell? Can anyone with intelligence really believe that a child born today should be doomed because the snake tempted Eve and Eve tempted Adam? To believe that is not God-worship; it is devil-worship.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.573851+00	626	5
1263	Many Christians base the belief of a soul and God upon the Bible. Strictly speaking, there is no such book. To make the Bible, sixty-six books are bound into one volume. These books are written by many people at different times, and no one knows the time or the identity of any author. Some of the books were written by several authors at various times. These books contain all sorts of contradictory concepts of life and morals and the origin of things. Between the first and the last nearly a thousand years intervened, a longer time than has passed since the discovery of America by Columbus.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.593991+00	626	5
1264	The fear of God is not the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God is the death of wisdom. Skepticism and doubt lead to study and investigation, and investigation is the beginning of wisdom. The modern world is the child of doubt and inquiry, as the ancient world was the child of fear and faith.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.614481+00	626	5
1265	Now hollow fires burn out to black,\nAnd lights are fluttering low:\nSquare your shoulders, lift your pack\nAnd leave your friends and go.\nO never fear, lads, naught's to dread,\nLook not to left nor right:\nIn all the endless road you tread\nThere's nothing but the night.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.635052+00	281	5

1280	...if I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.937441+00	226	5
1281	I am not responsible for what other people think. I am responsible only for what I myself think, and I know what that is. No idea I've ever come up with has ever struck me as a divine revelation. Nothing I have ever observed leads me to think there is a God watching over me.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.958522+00	226	5
1282	People everywhere enjoy believing things that they know are not true. It spares them the ordeal of thinking for themselves and taking responsibility for what they know.	2025-07-02 10:16:25.982776+00	699	5
1283	Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and distances,... and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and experience.  It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in Scripture.  We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, which people see as ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.005831+00	700	5
1284	If anyone can show me, and prove to me, that I am wrong in thought or deed, I will gladly change. I seek the truth, which never yet hurt anybody. It is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance which does harm.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.030259+00	701	5
1285	Men fear death as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased by tales, so is the other.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.048885+00	474	5

1287	The very concept of sin comes from the bible. Christianity offers to solve a problem of its own making! Would you be thankful to a person who cut you with a knife in order to sell you a bandage?	2025-07-02 10:16:26.10062+00	703	5

1290	You believe in a book that has talking animals, wizards, witches, demons, sticks turning into snakes, food falling from the sky, people walking on water, and all sorts of magical, absurd and primitive stories, and you say that\nwe\nare the ones that need help?	2025-07-02 10:16:26.159472+00	703	5

1293	The world presents enough problems if you believe it to be a world of law and order; do not add to them by believing it to be a world of miracles.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.229769+00	706	5
1294	And don't tell me God works in mysterious ways... There's nothing so mysterious about it. He's not working at all. He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about us. That's the kind of God you people talk about - a country bumpkin, a clumsy, bungling, brainless, conceited, uncouth hayseed. Good God, how much reverence can you have for a Supreme Being who finds it necessary to include such phenomena as phlegm and tooth decay in His divine system of creation? What in the world was running through that warped, evil, scatalogical mind of His when He robbed old people of the power to control their bowel movements? Why in the world did He ever create pain?	2025-07-02 10:16:26.251854+00	707	5

1297	Do not feed children on maudlin sentimentalism or dogmatic religion; give them nature... Do not terrify them in early life with the fear of an after-world.  Never was a child made more noble and good by the fear of a hell.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.312407+00	709	5
1298	Let us read the Bible without the ill-fitting colored spectacles of theology, just as we read other books, using our own judgment and reason, listening to the voice within, not to the noisy babel without. Most of us possess discriminating reasoning powers. Can we use them or must we be fed by others like babes?	2025-07-02 10:16:26.329897+00	709	5
1299	The idea that a good God would send people to a burning hell is utterly damnable to me. I don't want to have anything to do with such a God. But while I cannot conceive of such a God, I do recognize the existence of a great universal power -- a power which we cannot even begin to comprehend and might as well not attempt to. It may be a conscious mind, or it may not. I don't know. As a scientist I should like to know, but as a man, I am not so vitally concerned.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.345783+00	709	5
1300	As for Christ - well, he has been most outrageously belied. His followers, like those of many scientists and literary men, have so garbled his words and conduct that many of them no longer apply to present life. Christ was a wonderful psychologist. He was an infidel of his day because he rebelled against the prevailing religions and government. I am a lover of Christ as a man, and his work and all things that help humanity, but nevertheless just as he was an infidel then, I am an infidel today.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.361831+00	709	5
1301	The more I study religions the more I am convinced that man never worshipped anything but himself.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.381072+00	710	5
1302	Awe is a large flower, but a short-lived one. Besides, when God cracks a joke or two and clearly hopes you'll ask him over for a drink, you lose respect. If God wants worship, he'd better stay lonely. If he wants love, he'll have to eat shit with the rest of us.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.401983+00	711	5

1313	Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there. The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever and we are alone. Live our lives, lacking anything better to do; Devise reason later. Born from Oblivion, bear children, hell-bound as ourselves, go into Oblivion. There is nothing else. Existence is random; has no pattern save what we imagine after staring at it too long; no meaning save what we choose to impose. This rudderless world is not shaped by vague metaphysical forces. It is not God who kills the children. Not Fate that butchers them or Destiny that feeds them to the dogs. It's us. Only us.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.620416+00	42	5

1316	Naturally, since [the Sumerians] didn't know what caused the flood anymore than we do, they blamed the gods.  (That's the advantage of religion. You're never short an explanation for anything.)	2025-07-02 10:16:26.680183+00	226	5

1320	As a parent, I [also] realize what my role is in protecting my child from influences that might have a disturbing effect... I cannot sit back and hope that the government or some public interest groups will protect her; that responsibility is up to my wife and myself alone. As soon as we as a society abdicate our personal responsibility towards protecting and caring for our children we give up our basic freedoms as Americans; freedoms that have been hard fought and even harder won.\nAs parents, we must look into our own backyards and see what our children are doing and become more personally involved with their activities, ideas and friends.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.767728+00	722	5

1322	For some reason or other man looks for the miracle, and to accomplish it he will wade through blood.  He will debauch himself with ideas, he will reduce himself to a shadow if for only one second of his life he can close his eyes to the hideousness of reality. Everything is endured--disgrace, humiliation, poverty, war, crime, ennui--in the belief that overnight something will occur, a miracle, which will render life tolerable.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.807513+00	187	5
1323	It's silly to go on pretending that under the skin we are all brothers. The truth is more likely that under the skin we are all cannibals, assassins, traitors, liars, hypocrites, poltroons.	2025-07-02 10:16:26.829204+00	187	5

1331	Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business. ... I think all the religious leaders will forgive me because I think that's what religion's about. I haven't started any wars throughout time. Has religion?	2025-07-02 10:16:27.005592+00	726	5

1333	I keep a conscience uncorrupted by religion, a judgment undimmed by politics and patriotism, a heart untainted by friendships and sentiments unsoured by animosities.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.065773+00	63	5
1334	It is amazing how childishly gullible humans are. There are, for example, so many different religions - each of them claiming to have the truth, each saying that their truths are clearly superior to the truths of others - how can someone possibly take any of them seriously? I mean, that's insane. And such insanity concerns me, especially now that waves of lunacy are washing over the United States and the world in the form of millennial cults... The crazy thing is, according to traditional Christian dogma, the real millennium was four years ago, for Jesus was supposedly born circa 5 B.C.E. - so it's already 2004! Apparently some millennial nuts are blithely ignoring their own dogma.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.097654+00	4	5

1336	Frankenstein took some flesh and bones and blood and made a man out of them; the man ran away and fell to raping and robbing and murdering everywhere, and Frankenstein was horrified and in despair, and said, "I made him, without asking his consent, and it makes me responsible for every crime he commits. I am the criminal, he is innocent." ... [That's exactly] the case of God and man... God made man, without man's consent, and made his nature, too; made it vicious instead of angelic, and then said, "Be angelic, or I will ill punish you and destroy you." But no matter, God is responsible for everything man does, all the same; He can't get around that fact. There is only one Criminal, and it is not man.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.16261+00	72	5
1337	There is no absurdity so palpable but that it may be firmly planted in the human head if you only begin to inculcate it before the age of five, by constantly repeating it with an air of great solemnity.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.189623+00	728	5
1338	When there are rational grounds for an opinion, people are content to set them forth and wait for them to operate. In such cases, people do not hold their opinions with passion; they hold them calmly, and set forth their reasons quietly. The opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists; indeed the passion is the measure of the holder's lack of rational conviction.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.212558+00	458	5

1341	There is nothing that can be said by mathematical symbols and relations which cannot also be said by words. The converse, however, is false. Much that can be and is said by words cannot successfully be put into equations, because it is nonsense.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.283384+00	731	5
1342	Everyone wants to be foremost in this future-and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that men do not want to think at all of the idea of death!	2025-07-02 10:16:27.303399+00	64	5

1345	When the philosopher's argument becomes tedious, complicated, and opaque, it is usually a sign that he is attempting to prove as true to the intellect what is plainly false to common sense.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.363215+00	68	5
1349	Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need strength in numbers. It tells people to go out and stick their noses in other people's business.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.443304+00	726	5
1350	Make it as close to the truth as you can, the better to make it a lie.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.46758+00	733	5
1351	You're obliged to pretend and respect people and instituitions you think absurb. You live attached in a cowardly fashion to moral and social conventions you despise, condemn and know lack all foundation. It is that permanent contradiction between your ideas and desires and all the dead formalities and vain pretenses of your civilization that make you sad, troubled and unbalanced. In that intolerable conflict you lose all joy if life and all felling of personality, becuase at every moment they supress and restain and check the free play of your powers. That's the poisoned and mortal wound of the civilized world.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.488164+00	568	5
1352	There is a price to be paid for freedom... a slave has no options but a free person must choose a direction.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.505987+00	\N	5
1353	Like a withered leaf are you now; Death's messengers await you. You stand on the eve of your departure. Yet you have made no provisions for your journey.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.530406+00	734	5
1354	It is fortunate for those in power that people do not think.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.552087+00	21	5

1356	The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed - and hence clamorous to be led to safety - by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.597082+00	444	5
1357	Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.616211+00	116	5
1358	...the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us. So don't expect the end of the world to come one day out of the blue - it's been happening every day for a long time.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.639305+00	736	5
1359	Knowledge [is] something that has always stood in the way of religous tyranny.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.663524+00	737	5
1360	The origin of all science is the desire to know causes, and the origin of all false science and imposture is the desire to accept false causes rather than none; or, which is the same thing, in the unwillingness to acknowledge our own ignorance.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.685229+00	738	5
1361	The aim of those who try to control thought is always the same. They find one single explanation of the world, one system of thought and action that will (they believe) cover everything; and then they try to impose that on all thinking people.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.711171+00	739	5
1362	Fear the faith that's not the shape of your soul.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.746386+00	740	5
1363	...if one thing frightens people, it is that so much happens, on earth and out in space, the reasons for which seem somehow to escape them, and they fill in the gap by putting it down to the gods.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.768655+00	651	5
1364	One thing is made of another, and nature allows no new creation except at the price of death.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.786466+00	651	5
1365	Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion go hand in hand.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.806323+00	458	5
1366	Many people have the reasoning facility, but no one uses it in religious matters.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.825055+00	72	5
1367	The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in escaping the old ones, which ramify, for those brought up as most of us have been, into every corner of our minds.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.847029+00	741	5
1368	The tendency has always been strong to believe that whatever received a name must be an entity or being, having an independent existence of its own. And if no real entity answering to the name could be found, men did not for that reason suppose that none existed, but imagined that it was something peculiarly abstruse and mysterious.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.865995+00	484	5
1369	Ours is the age which is proud of machines that think and suspicious of men who try to.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.890815+00	742	5
1370	The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who, in a time of moral crisis, remain neutral.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.915865+00	743	5
1371	To be born in imbecility, in the midst of pain and crisis; to be the plaything of ignorance, error, need, sickness, wickedness, and passions; to return step by step to imbecility, from the time of lisping to that of doting; to live among knaves and charlatans of all kinds; to die between one man who takes your pulse and another who troubles your head; never to know where you come from, why you come and where you are going! That is what is called the most important gift of our parents and nature. Life.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.941834+00	744	5
1372	A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.961768+00	189	5
1373	The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive and unrealistic.	2025-07-02 10:16:27.980808+00	215	5
1374	Human beings never think for themselves... For the most part, members of our species simply repeat what they are told--and become upset if they are exposed to any different view. The characteristic human trait is not awareness but conformity... We are stubborn, self-destructive conformists. Any other view of our species is just a self-congratulatory delusion.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.000233+00	487	5
1375	There is no other life; life itself is only a vision and a dream for nothing exists but space and you. If there was an all-powerful God, he would have made all good, and no bad.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.017323+00	72	5
1376	Every living thing is a sort of imperialist, seeking to transform as much as possible of its environment into itself.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.036189+00	458	5
1377	You can educate yourself right out of a relationship with God.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.058144+00	745	5
1378	The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.078365+00	21	5
1379	The Devil's strategy for our times is to trivialize human existence and isolate us from one another while creating the delusion that the reasons are time pressures, work demands or economic anxieties.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.099085+00	746	5
1380	Should we be obeying some old piece of paper or should we make our own decisions?	2025-07-02 10:16:28.12211+00	747	5
1381	To be patriotic, hate all nations but your own; to be religious, all sects but your own; to be moral, all pretenses but your own.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.143255+00	748	5
1382	... reason accepts no commandments.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.161441+00	135	5
1383	In those parts of the world where learning and science has prevailed, miracles have ceased; But in those parts of it as are barbarous and ignorant, miracles are still in vogue.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.184292+00	749	5
1385	People want to be at the center of the Universe...and they're going to flock to anybody who tells them that.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.226869+00	751	5
1386	... these highly exalted "linchpins," particularly in the Judeo-Christian and Islamic traditions, are nothing more than a carrot-and-stick approach to "morality." Do good or else! Goodness is not promoted for its own sake. It is promoted as a means of avoiding God's wrath and damnation. This is the antithesis of morality. You're doing something good solely because you're afraid of what might happen to you (frying in hell) if you don't. You're looking out for Number One---pure selfishness---the opposite of truly moral behavior.\nBy contrast, those of us who don't believe there are any gods or devils snapping at our heels, do good simply because we feel compassion, and want to help. Surely this is truly moral behavior. We are seeking no spiritual rewards or brownie points for the hereafter. We just want to help.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.246009+00	581	5
1387	The pleasure of hating, like a poisonous mineral, eats into the heart of religion, and turns it to rankling spleen and bigotry; it makes patriotism an excuse for carrying fire, pestilence, and famine into other lands: it leaves to virtue nothing but the spirit of censoriousness, and a narrow, jealous, inquisitorial watchfulness over the actions and motives of others.  What have the different sects, creeds, doctrines in religion been but so many pretexts set up for men to wrangle, to quarrel, to tear one another in pieces about, like a target as a mark to shoot at?	2025-07-02 10:16:28.266921+00	752	5
1388	Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if the world should perish twice, I think I know enough of hate, to say that for destruction, ice is also great, and would suffice.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.285205+00	70	5
1389	The path of excess leads to the tower of wisdom.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.303024+00	277	5
1390	We need not fear those who do evil in the name of evil, but Heaven protect us from those who do evil in the name of good.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.325759+00	753	5
1391	No one holds command over me. No man. No god. No Prince. What is a claim of age for ones who are immortal? What is a claim of power for ones who defy death? Call your damnable hunt. We shall see whom I drag screaming to hell with me.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.347495+00	754	5
1392	The mind is it's own place, and of itself can make a heaven of hell, and a hell of heaven.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.366862+00	49	5
1393	The bullet that will kill me has not yet been cast.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.387048+00	245	5
1394	The only perfect circle on the human body is the eye. When a baby is born it's so perfect, but when it opens its eyes it's just blinded by the corruption and everything else is a downward spiral.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.410397+00	755	5
1395	I believe that in your heart you already know something is profoundly wrong. When bartenders are responsible for drunk drivers' acts, and gunmakers are responsible for criminals' acts, and nobody is responsible for O. J. Simpson's acts, something is wrong.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.433344+00	756	5
1396	Our minds are circumscribed by our immediate reality, but we stop short at the thought of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.453694+00	757	5
1397	Realist: The word means so many things to so many different people that it should never be used without the utmost care. Nevertheless, one might rashly put up the word now and then as a farmer puts up a scarecrow, in the hope that ungrounded minds might fly elsewhere.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.475103+00	757	5
1398	What upsets me is not that you lied to me, but that from now on I can no longer believe you.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.494837+00	64	5
1399	There was a hole inside his soul a manicure could not fill\nso he found himself a whore to love\nwhile daisies choked in the window sill.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.512885+00	\N	5
1400	He sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see,\nHe tries to tell me what I put inside of me,\nHe's got the answers to ease my curiosity,\nHe dreamed a god up and called it christianity.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.534891+00	758	5
1401	Of all escape mechanisms, death is the most efficient.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.555553+00	444	5
1402	Men always try to make virtues of their weaknesses. Fear of death and fear of life both become piety.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.575513+00	444	5
1403	What sort of meaning would you like [life] to have? Propose to me a meaning for life. Anything you want. Well, when people try to think of what the meaning of life is, they say 'Well, I think that we're all part of a plan, and [we're] working as if we were characters in a novel or a play, and we are all working towards a great fulfillment. One day, perhaps after we're dead, perhaps in the future life, there'll be a great gazoozie. There'll be a galuptious, glorious goodie at the end of the line, see? And that's what we're all for, see? To get in with that. And it will all be very, very important, because it won't be something trivial. It will be something extremely holy.' Well I say, 'What's your idea of something very holy?' Well, nobody really knows. You know, they think about church, and medieval artists who used to represent heaven in the form of everybody sitting in choir stalls. [It] looked insufferably dull. And when those little children sang hymns about those eternal sabbaths, it was a very depressing future, I can assure you.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.600515+00	759	5
1404	Nothing's beautiful from every point of view.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.620683+00	696	5
1405	I prefer to be true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others, rather than to be false, and to incur my own abhorrence.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.644435+00	760	5
1406	If you don't control your mind, someone else will.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.667576+00	761	5
1407	Nothing is so firmly believed as that which we least know.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.685484+00	447	5
1408	Men love their ideas more than their lives. And the more preposterous the idea, the more eager they are to die for it. And to kill for it.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.704829+00	68	5
1409	We do not know what to do with this short life, yet we yearn for another that will be eternal.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.723493+00	574	5
1410	The last 100 years of research into the human brain...sees the brain as an organ that works by physical principles just like the other organs in the body...our emotions and higher callings, such as religion, as well as our grubby low-level physical systems like stereo vision and motor control, are products of a machine...	2025-07-02 10:16:28.74387+00	729	5
1411	It is difficult to imagine anyone having any real hopes for the human race in the face of the fact that the great majority of men still believe that the universe is run by a gaseous vertebrate of astronomical heft and girth, who is nevertheless interested in the minutest details of the private conduct of even the meanest man.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.764058+00	444	5
1412	There is no other word in the human language that is as meaningless and incapable of explanation as is the word 'God.'... It is the Alpha and Omega of Ignorance. It has as many meanings as there are minds. And as each person has an opinion of what the word God ought to mean, it is a word without premise, without foundation, and without substance... It is all things to all people, and is as meaningless as it is indefinable.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.788231+00	762	5
1413	There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.808568+00	569	5
1414	To control and enslave the minds of men, all one must do is convince them that a secret exists, and that he is privy to information regarding that secret; hence the power of priests and psychics.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.832456+00	763	5
1415	He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.852599+00	277	5
1416	Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education; they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.875698+00	764	5
1417	Principles are as often as not an excuse to stop thinking about matters that are difficult because they require judgment, and, as such, principles often constitute a sort of moral cowardice.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.904975+00	765	5
1418	The most heinous and the most cruel crimes of which history has record have been committed under the cover of religion or equally noble motives.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.938821+00	766	5
1419	I have seen war. I have seen war on land and sea. I have seen blood running from the wounded. I have seen men coughing out their gassed lungs. I have seen the dead in the mud. I have seen cities destroyed... I have seen children starving. I have seen the agony of mothers and wives. I hate war.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.965215+00	270	5
1420	There are no warlike peoples -- just warlike leaders.	2025-07-02 10:16:28.99049+00	767	5
1421	War is at its best barbarism... Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have never fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation. War is hell.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.014726+00	768	5
1422	The tragedy of war is that it uses man's best to do man's worst.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.038068+00	769	5
1423	May God have mercy upon my enemies, because I won't.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.063075+00	770	5
1424	All men are frightened. The more intelligent they are the more they are frightened. The couragous man is the man who forces himself in spite of his fear to carry on.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.083574+00	268	5
1425	The military don't start wars. Politicians start wars.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.109256+00	771	5
1426	Dig a hole in your back yard while it is raining. Sit in the hole until the water climbs up around your ankles. Pour cold mud down your shirt collar. Sit there for forty-eight hours, and, so there is no danger of your dozing off, imagine that a guy is sneaking around waiting for a chance to club you on the head or set your house on fire. Get out of the hole, fill a suitcase with rocks, pick it up, put a shotgun in your other hand, and walk on the muddiest road you can find. Fall flat on your face every few minutes as you imagine big meteors streaking down to sock you. After ten or twelve miles (remember, you are still carrying the shotgun and suitcase) start sneaking through the wet brush. Imagine that somebody has booby-trapped your route with rattlesnakes which will bite you if you step on them. Give some friend a rifle and have him blast in your direction once in a while. Snoop around until you find a bull. Try to figure out a way to sneak around him without letting him see you. When he does see you, run like hell all the way back to your hole in the back yard, drop the suitcase and shotgun, and get in. If you repeat this performance every three days for several months you may begin to understand why an infantryman sometimes gets out of breath. But you still won't understand how he feels when things get tough.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.133287+00	772	5
1427	My hands are small, but they're not yours, they are my own... I am never broken.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.15783+00	773	5
1428	If God created us, and expects to worship him, we are nothing more than slaves.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.181631+00	774	5

1431	History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.247753+00	776	5
1432	All men dream, but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.271463+00	777	5
1433	Oh, what it is to live your life, when every day you fight the frost, knowing well the day will come when ice crawls up your spine, and lays you down, forever stiff, together with the cold.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.296205+00	778	5
1434	Death makes angels of us all and put wings where we once had shoulders, smooth as raven's wings.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.315017+00	693	5
1435	Democracy promotes Conformity, Conformity promotes Ignorance, Ignorance promotes Fear, and Fear promotes Hate. And they wonder why the country is at war with itself.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.339882+00	779	5

1437	Thank you, your honour. You have completed Mahathir's plan. We will meet again in 2014 or earlier.\nThere has been no criminal trial in this court, only political persecution. The pronoucement of your judgement today was a mere formality, according to the preordained script of the conspirators.\nThis judgement has no legal basis. It does not disgrace me. It disgraces you and this nation of ours. Let the plotters plot all they want, for God is still the best of schemers.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.379163+00	780	5
1438	Men love war because it allows them to look serious. Because they imagine it is the one thing that stops women laughing at them. In it they can reduce women to the status of objects. That is the great distinction between the sexes: men see objects, women see the relationship between objects. Whether the objects need each other, love each other, match each other. [...] War is a psychosis caused by an inability to see relationships...	2025-07-02 10:16:29.398818+00	781	5

1441	Following these faiths based on mythological figures insures the destruction of one's inner being. Organized religion destroys who we are by inhibiting our actions, by inhibiting our decisions, out of fear of some intangible parent figure who shakes a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says do it, do it, and I'll fucking spank you!	2025-07-02 10:16:29.446055+00	\N	5

1443	"My friend, "said Hugh, "I doubt even you could get Susanna in among the saints. She's placed herself far outside the reach of human mercy. And now I suppose you'll tell me roundly that God's reach is longer than man's"\n"It had better be, "said Cadfael, "Otherwise we're all lost."	2025-07-02 10:16:29.48492+00	782	5

1452	I have found God, but He is insufficient. I am only spiritually dead. Physically, I am alive. Morally, I am free. The world I leave behind is a menagerie. The dawn is breaking on a new world. A jungle world, in which the lean spirits roam with sharp claws. If I am a hyena, I am a lean and hungry one. I go forth to fatten myself.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.650657+00	187	5

1457	Some say that it is pathetic that we work for money, use this money to survive, and survive to have children that will go through the same pattern... I think it only makes death less of a dramatic event in one's life.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.737466+00	786	5
1458	Q: Do you think there's a God, some kind of supreme being or force in our universe?\nA: I don't know. I don't believe in any religion. I think religions are among the greatest curses that ever afflicted mankind - look at all the wars and miseries they've caused. Perhaps the universe was here forever. Perhaps one day we may know the answer.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.760386+00	787	5
1459	Q: But when you look at the design and the order in the universe, do you think it's logical to suppose that there's somekind of rational force behind it all?\nA: Yes, the old argument for design has been around for a long time. The people who try to claim there must be a designer behind the universe only point at the good things that this designer has done. Our world is full of utterly horrible, atrocious things.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.77865+00	787	5
1460	Q: But when you look at the univers - its scale and its beauty - are you not filled with a profound sense of awe?\nA: It's wonderful and incomprehensible. It's beyond imagination, how huge and complex it is.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.796691+00	787	5

1462	What the church has to offer: a teaching in the belief of Christ under a "no-questions-asked" policy, the ability to be loved by a million ignorants and the opportunity to open a savings account in the bank of the Vatican.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.840681+00	789	5
1463	If heaven is perfect, then the Christian god is an anarchist. Anarchy has always been seen as the anti-goverment, and it really is, it is based on the morals of the masses than the corruptness of a minority.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.856445+00	\N	5

1465	Pondering is the quintessential essence of the intelligent man, for without the art of thinking, man would be nothing but a disheveled mass of flesh and bone.  Unfortunately, the art of thinking in logical terms has become somewhat extinct, the face of this planet is covered with idiots. The smart ones are always crazy, the one's that can think for themselves are punished by society for being an outcasts... nothing will ever be done about it, how can one have faith in a world that put George W. Bush in a position of power.	2025-07-02 10:16:29.897047+00	200	5
1466	For today, we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives. We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of pure ideology. Where each worker may bloom secure from the pests of contradictory and confusing truths. Our Unification of Thought is more powerful a weapon than any fleet or army on earth. We are one people. With one will. One resolve. One cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death. And we will bury them with their own confusion. We shall prevail!	2025-07-02 10:16:29.91348+00	\N	5

1472	Everything about human nature reduces life to a routine.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.033908+00	367	5
1473	According to the bible, Heaven is completely perfect and Hell is completely evil. In Heaven, in order to keep everything completely perfect, everyone in it would have to follow a long, specific set of rules for it to be perfect. Heaven is prison. In Hell, everyone is already evil there, so no rules need to be set to make it completely evil. Hell is freedom.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.057222+00	793	5
1474	Escape is not the answer to freedom. Not sex, not drugs, not your little fairy-tale land in the clouds, not even death. You wanna be free? You better be fucking ready to fight. Tooth and nail.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.077858+00	794	5
1475	As Hitler showed us, a press suppressed does not make a recovery. As Lenin indicated, a press controlled does not revert to a critic's role. As history reminds us, free speech surrendered is rarely recovered.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.097959+00	795	5

1484	What you hold in your hand is proof of man's power - against which our strength means nothing. It has the force of 100 spears. I warn you, man's ingenuity goes hand-in-hand with their cruelty. No creature is as devious or violent.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.258465+00	756	5
1485	At Auschwitz, Hitler declared, "I freed germany form the stupid and degrading fallacies of conscience and morality... We will train young people before whome the world will tremble."	2025-07-02 10:16:30.279275+00	798	5
1486	I saw him open his mouth wide -- it gave him a weirdly voracious aspect, as though he had wanted to swallow all the air, all the earth, all the men before him.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.296549+00	349	5
1487	Violence in the media making people shoot other people? Any pile of stunted growth who isn't aware that entertainment is just that and nothing more deserves to doom themselves to some dark cell somewhere for having been so stupid.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.317522+00	799	5
1488	Woe to the people that fails to honor its heroes! It will cease producing them, cease knowing them. Heroes spring from the essence of their people. A people without heroes is a people without leaders, for only a heroic leader is a true leader able to withstand the challenge of difficult times.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.340077+00	800	5
1489	Today, communication itself is the problem. We have become the world's first overcommunicated society. Each year we send more and receive less.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.359227+00	801	5
1490	The sleep of reason breeds monsters.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.378418+00	802	5
1491	We all have inner demons to fight, we call these demons, fear and hatred and anger. If you do not conquer them then a life of one hundred years is a tragedy. If you do, then a life of a single day can be a triumph.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.399487+00	803	5
1492	Nothing is bigger than life. There's nothing noble in death. What's noble about never seeing the sunshine again? What's noble about having your legs and arms blown off? What's noble about being an idiot? What's noble about being blind and deaf and dumb? What's noble about being dead?	2025-07-02 10:16:30.422043+00	804	5
1493	I was drowning my sorrows, but my sorrows, they learned to swim.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.440334+00	365	5

1495	The 3 types of terror: The Gross-out: the sight of a severed head tumbling down a flight of stairs, it's when the lights go out and something green and slimy splatters against your arm. The Horror: the unnatural, spiders the size of bears, the dead waking up and walking around, it's when the lights go out and something with claws grabs you by the arm. And the last and worse one: Terror, when you come home and notice everything you own had been taken away and replaced by an exact substitute. It's when the lights go out and you feel something behind you, you hear it, you feel its breath against your ear, but when you turn around, there's nothing there...	2025-07-02 10:16:30.488297+00	806	5

1499	There are heroes in this world. They're called district attorneys. They don't get to have clients, people who smile at them at the end of the trial, who look them in the eye and say, 'Thank you.' Nobody's there to appreciate the district attorney because we work for the state, and our gratitude comes only from knowing there's a tide out there - a tide the size of a tsunami coming out of a bottomless cesspool, a tide called crime, which, if left unchecked, will rob every American of his freedom, a tide which strips individuals of the privilege of being able to walk down a dark street or take $20 out of an ATM machine without fear of being mugged. All Congress does is talk, but it's the district attorney who grabs his sword, who digs into the trenches and fights the fight, who dogs justice day after day after day without thanks, without so much as a simple pat on the back, but we do it. We do it. We do it because we are the crusaders, the last frontier of American justice, knowing that if a man cannot feel safe, he can never, never feel free.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.574921+00	810	5
1500	Everyone is afraid of dying, why? If you are completely happy with life, then when you die, you are only moving onto the next phase of life. It doesn't matter if there is life after death because no one has ever died and come back. Also, if there is a heaven, it would have to be made up of everyone's perspective of heaven. If not then there is no such thing as heaven and religion is nothing but bullshit.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.591062+00	\N	5
1501	Books won't stay banned. They won't burn. Ideas won't go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and the inquisitor have always lost. The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better ideas. The source of better ideas is wisdom. The surest path to wisdom is a liberal education.	2025-07-02 10:16:30.613644+00	811	5
1502	But if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That failure becomes our destination. To love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful experience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.398465+00	812	6
1518	How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!\nThe world forgetting, by the world forgot.\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\nEach pray'r fulfilled, and each wish resign'd...	2025-07-02 10:16:31.72135+00	281	6
1519	If you could have the arms of Hercules, legs as swift as the wind. If you could leap shoulder high above the rim, have the kick of a dolphin, the reflexes of a cat. If you could have all these, you would have the body, you would have the tools. But you would not have greatness until you understand that the strongest muscle is the heart. To me, that's the soul of the Olympic Games.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.742787+00	820	6
1535	I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.107085+00	243	6
1554	Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having  to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?	2025-07-02 10:16:32.503924+00	48	6
1503	As it is, we are merely bolting our livesgulping down undigested experiences as fast as we can stuff them inbecause awareness of our own existence is so superficial and so narrow that nothing seems to us more boring than simple being.  If I ask you what you did, saw, heard, smelled, touched and tasted yesterday, I am likely to get nothing more than the thin, sketchy outline of the few things that you noticed, and of those only what you thought worth remembering. Is it surprising that an existence so experienced seems so empty and bare that its hunger for an infinite future is insatiable? But suppose you could answer, It would take me forever to tell you, and I am much too interested in whats happening now. How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and such a fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience itself as anything less than a god? And, when you consider that this incalculably subtle organism is inseparable from the still more marvelous patterns of its environmentfrom the minutest electrical designs to the whole company of the galaxieshow is it conceivable that this incarnation of all eternity can be bored with being?	2025-07-02 10:16:31.416004+00	759	6

1506	The arts are not a way of making a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward. You will have created something.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.473182+00	118	6
1507	Nothing we have is worth hurting anyone else for. It's all fleeting people. Stop seeing race, colour, sex, religion, etc... They are all just people, and if you try to love them you won't lose anything.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.494187+00	814	6
1508	Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldnt be here if stars hadnt exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - werent created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.515234+00	815	6
1509	Only a very few would allow creatures like us to exist. Thus our presence selects out from this vast array only these universes that are compatible without existence. Although we are puny and insignificant on the scale of the cosmos, this makes us in a sense, the lords of creation.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.533394+00	813	6
1510	We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.551639+00	118	6
1511	It is one of the most beautiful compensations in life... that no man can sincerely try to help another without helping himself.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.569834+00	141	6
1512	Death is not extinguishing the light. It is putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.592437+00	816	6
1513	How is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded, 'This is better than we thought! The Universe is much bigger than our prophets said, grander, more subtle, more elegant'? Instead they say, 'No, no, no! My god is a little god, and I want him to stay that way.' A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the Universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.610974+00	302	6
1514	After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color and bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? This is how I answer when I am asked - as I am surprisingly often - why I bother to get up in the mornings. To put it the other way round, isn't it sad to go to your grave without ever wondering why you were born? Who, with such a though, would not spring from bed, eager to resume discovering the world and rejoicing to be part of it?	2025-07-02 10:16:31.630331+00	161	6
1515	Life is, in fact, a battle. On this point optimists and pessimists agree. Evil is insolent and strong: beauty enchanting but rare; goodness very apt to be weak; folly very apt to be defiant; wickedness to carry the day; imbeciles to be in very great places, people of sense in small, and mankind generally, unhappy. But the world as it stands is no illusion, no phantasm, no evil dream of a night; we wake up to it again and again for ever and ever; we can neither forget it nor deny it nor dispense with it. We can welcome experience as it comes, and give it what it demands, in exchange for something which is idle to pause to call much or little so long as it contributes to swell the volume of consciousness. In this there is mingled pain and delight, but over the mysterious mixture there hovers a visible rule, that bids us learn to will and seek to understand.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.653587+00	817	6
1516	The truly creative mind in any field is no more than this: A human creature born abnormally, inhumanly sensitive. To him... a touch is a blow, a sound is a noise, a misfortune is a tragedy, a joy is an ecstasy, a friend is a lover, a lover is a god, and failure is death. Add to this cruelly delicate organism the overpowering necessity to create, create, create -- so that without the creating of music or poetry or books or buildings or something of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By some strange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really alive unless he is creating.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.676051+00	818	6

1520	Anybody can see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman that she will become. A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl she used to be. A great artist can look at an old woman, protray her exactly as she is... and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be... more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo see that this lovely young girl is still alive, prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you feel the quiet, endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older that eighteen in her heart... no matter what merciless hours have done. Look at her. Growing old doesn't matter to you and me- but it does to them. Look at her!	2025-07-02 10:16:31.765442+00	821	6

1522	Man is a fraction of the animal world. Our history is an afterthought, no more, tacked to an infinite calender. We are not so unique as we should like to believe. And if man in a time of need seeks deeper knowledge concerning himself, then he must explore those animal horizons from which we have made our quick little march.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.808268+00	822	6
1523	The sudden departure of several quintillion atoms from a universe they had no right to be in anyway caused in wild imbalance in the harmony in the Sum Totality which it tried frantically to retrieve, wiping out a number of subrealities in the process. Huge surges of raw magic boiled uncontrolled around the very foundations of the multiverse itself, welling up through every crevice into hitherto peaceful dimensions and causing novas, supernovas, stellar collisions, wild flights of geese and drowning of imaginary continents. Worlds as far away as from the other end of time experienced brilliant sunsets of coruscating octarine as highly-charged magical particles roared through the atmosphere. In the cometary halo around the fabled Ice-System of Zeret a noble comet died as a prince flamed across the sky.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.832722+00	823	6
1524	There are more stars known to exist right now than the total number of all the grains of sand on every beach in the entire world. With those kinds of odds, it would seem downright naive for someone to go to a beach in, say, some out-of-the-way inlet in Baffin Bay, stoop to pick up only one tiny grain of sand, and declare that that grain alone was the only place where life could exist.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.856161+00	824	6
1525	Perhaps we are looking at this from a wrong perspective; this search for the truth, the meaning of life, the reason of God. We all have this mindset that the answers are so complex and so vast that it is almost impossible to comprehend.\nI think, on the contrary, that the answers are so simple; so simple that it is staring us straight in the face, screaming its lungs out, and yet we fail to notice it. We're looking through a telescope, searching the stars for the answer, when the answer is actually a speck of dirt on the telescope's lens.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.875402+00	17	6

1528	HIGH FLIGHT\nOh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth\nAnd danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;\nSunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth\nOf sun-split clouds and done a hundred things\nYou have not dreamed of wheeled and soared and swung\nHigh in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there,\nI've chased the shouting wind along, and flung\nMy eager craft through footless halls of air.\nUp, up the long, delirious, burning blue\nI've topped the windswept heights with easy grace\nWhere never lark, or even eagle flew\nAnd, while with silent, lifting mind I've trod\nThe high untrespassed sanctity of space,\nPut out my hand, and touched the face of God.	2025-07-02 10:16:31.952265+00	827	6

1530	Humans are not only storytelling animals, we are also pattern-seeking animals, and there is a tendency to find pattern even when none exists. To most of us the pattern of the universe indicates design. For countless millennia we have taken these patterns and constructed stories about how our cosmos was designed specifically for us. For the past few centuries, however, science has presented us with a viable alternative in which we are but one among tens of millions of species, housed on but one planet among many orbiting an ordinary solar system, itself one among possibly billions of solar systems in an ordinary galaxy, located in a cluster of galaxies not so different than billions of other galaxy clusters, themselves whirling away from one another in an expanding cosmic bubble that very possibly is only one among a near infinite number of bubble universes. Is it really possible that this entire cosmological multiverse exists for one tiny subgroup of a single species on one planet in a lone galaxy in that solitary bubble universe?	2025-07-02 10:16:31.99695+00	483	6

1532	The spacious firmament on bigh\nWith all the blue etherial sky\nAnd spangled heavens, a shining frame,\nTheir great original proclaim.\nThe unwearied sun, from day to day,\nDoes his Creator's power display,\nAnd published to every land\nThe work of an Almighty hand.\nSoon as the evening shades prevail,\nThe moon takes up the wondrous tale,\nAnd nightly to the list'ning earth\nRepeats the story of her birth;\nWhilst all the stars that round her burn,\nAnd all the planets, in their turn,\nConfirm the tidings as they roll,\nAnd spread the truth from pole to pole.\nWhat though in solemn silence all\nMove round this dark terrestrial ball\nWhat though no real voice, nor sound,\nAmidst their radiant orbs be found,\nIn reason's ear they all rejoice,\nAnd utter forth a glorious voice,\nForever singing as they shine,\nThe hand that made us is divine	2025-07-02 10:16:32.040186+00	530	6
1533	Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The trouble-makers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status-quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify, or vilify them. But the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.063228+00	829	6

1540	But attempting to understand God must come from a timeless perspective - not creator God making something happen as a cause and effect. Because time is part of the physical universe. This God cannot be inside time and must be a timeless entity... I can't tell you what God is but what he is not. God is not a cosmic magician, not an old man in the sky, not a being within time at all. The closest definition I have is from theologian Paul Tillich: 'God is the ground of being. The rational ground in which the laws of the universe are rooted.' He is not an entity who is going to intervene in ruling of the world. But he is what stops the world from going berserk.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.219139+00	833	6

1542	If you get a drill and drill down 5km beneath the ground, it's teeming with life - millions of tiny living fossils. They resemble the earliest life forms and suggest that life started under the Ground. The bible talks of Eden as a sunny parkland with white fluffy clouds, but it probably ascended from the region that we now associate with Hell.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.257553+00	833	6
1543	Anything you don't understand, Mr. Rankin, you attribute to God. God for you is where you sweep away all the mysteries of the world, all the challenges to our intelligence. You simply turn your mind off and say God did it.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.277791+00	302	6
1544	The question ["Do you believe in God?"] has a peculiar structure. If I say no, do I mean I'm convinced God doesn't exist, or do I mean I'm not convinced he does exist? Those are two very different questions.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.296345+00	302	6

1546	Hope springs eternal in the human breast;\nMan never Is, but always To be Blest.\nThe soul, uneasy, and confin'd from home,\nRest and expatiates in a life to come.\nLo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind\nSees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind;\nHis soul proud Science never taught to stray\nFar as the solar walk or milky way;\nYet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,\nBehind the cloud-topp'd hill, an humbler heav'n.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.338932+00	281	6
1547	... humans are, by nature, a forward-looking species always seeking greater levels of happiness and satisfaction. Unfortunately, the corollary is that humans are all too often willing to grasp at unrealistic promises of a better life or to believe that a better life can only be attained by clinging to intolerance and ignorance, by lessening the lives of others. And sometimes, by focusing on a life to come, we miss what we have in this life. It is a different source of hope, but it is hope nonetheless: hope that human intelligence, combined with compassion, can solve our myriad problems and enhance the quality of each life; hope that historical progress continues on its march toward greater freedom and acceptance for all humans; and hope that reason and science as well as love and empathy can help us understand our universe, our world, and ourselves.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.359546+00	483	6
1548	When I talk to audiences about the size and age of the cosmos, people often say, "It makes me feel so insignificant." I answer, "The bigger and more impersonal the universe is, the more meaningful you are, because this vast, impersonal place needs something significant to fill it up." We've abandoned the old belief that humanity is at the physical center of the universe but more come back to believing we are at the center of meaning.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.383292+00	834	6
1549	What can be more soul shaking than peering through a 100-inch telescope at a distant galaxy, holding a 100-million-year-old fossil or a 500,000-year-old stone tool in one's hand, standing before the immense chasm of space and time that is the Grand Canyon, or listening to a scientist who gazed upon the face of the universe's creation and did not blink?	2025-07-02 10:16:32.402674+00	483	6
1550	..a world absent monsters, ghosts, demons, and gods unfetters the mind to soar to new heights, to think unthinkable thoughts, to imagine the unimaginable, to contemplate infinity and eternity knowing that no one is looking back. The universe takes on a whole new meaning when you know that your place in it was not foreordained, that it was not designed for us, indeed, that it was not designed at all. If we are nothing more than star stuff, how special life becomes. How inspiring it is to share in the sublimity of knowledge generated by other human minds, and perhaps to even make a tiny contribution toward that body of knowledge that will be passed down through the ages, part of the cumulative wisdom of a single species on a tiny planet orbiting an ordinary star on the remote edge of a not-so-unusual galaxy, itself a member of a cluster of galaxies millions of light years from nowhere. For me, the Hubble Telescope Deep Field photograph WFPC2, revealing as never before the rich density of galaxies in our neck of the universe ... is as grand a statement about the sacred as any medieval cathedral.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.423121+00	483	6
1551	There is... in our day, a powerful antidote to nonsense, which hardly existed in earlier times - I mean science. Science cannot be ignored or rejected, because it is bound up with modern technique; it is essential alike to prosperity in peace and to victory in war. That is, perhaps from an intellectual point of view, the most hopeful feature of our age, and the one which makes it most likely that we shall escape complete submersion in some new or old superstition.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.44138+00	458	6
1552	Reality is determined not by what scientists or anyone else says or believes but by what the evidence reveals to us.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.464469+00	835	6

1555	Nothing is more humbling than to look with a strong magnifying glass at an insect so tiny that the naked eye sees only the barest speck and to discover that nevertheless it is sculpted and articulated and striped with the same care and imagination as a zebra.  Apparently it does not occur to nature whether or not a creature is within our range of vision, and the suspicion arises that even the zebra was not designed for our benefit.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.525834+00	836	6
1556	Humanity has the stars in its future, and that future is too important to be lost under the burden of juvenile folly and ignorant superstition.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.54472+00	226	6
1557	If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: For it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.568712+00	837	6
1558	Suppose that we are wise enough to learn and know and yet not wise enough to control our learning and knowledge, so that we use it to destroy ourselves? Even if that is so, knowledge remains better than ignorance. It is better to know even if the knowledge endures only for the moment that comes before destruction than to gain eternal life at the price of a dull and swinish lack of comprehension of a universe that swirls unseen before us in all its wonder. That was the choice of Achilles, and it is mine, too.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.588692+00	226	6

1560	It was certainly not by design that the particles fell into order, they did not work out what they were going to do, but because many of them by many chances struck one another in the course of infinite time and encountered every possible form and movement, that they found at last the disposition they have, and that is how the universe was created.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.63757+00	651	6

1564	If acorns start growing into theologians, or if women begin turning into pillars of salt, then we may wish to hypothesize about a supernatural influence.

1565	... Carl Sagan estimated that there are a million technological civilizations in your galaxy alone. His more conservative colleague Frank Drake offers the number 10,000. John Oro calculates that the Milky Way is sprinkled with a hundred civilizations.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.759828+00	\N	6

1567	...we are, despite all our great technological advances, still very much a simple biological phenomenon. Despite our grandiose ideas and our lofty self-conceits, we are still humble animals, subject to all the basic laws of animal behaviour. ...We tend to suffer from a strange complacency..that there is something special about us, that we are somehow above biological control. But we are not. Many exciting species have become extinct in the past and we are no exception. Sooner or later we shall go, and make way for something else. If it is to be later rather than sooner, then we must take a long, hard look at ourselves as biological specimens and gain some understanding of our limitations.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.809705+00	842	6
1568	Q: Do you think there is intelligent life out there?\nA: I sometimes doubt whether there is intelligent life down here! It seems incredible that, in this enormous universe, we are the only intelligence. If we are the only intelligence in this gigantic universe, that's a tremendous responsibility.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.830516+00	787	6
1569	Q: But if there is life out there, do you think it will be more intelligent or less intelligent than us?\nA: Out in the universe, among those hundreds and thousands of stars and planets, we might find intelligence on all levels, from a slug up to something which we would call god-like.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.852006+00	787	6
1570	When I was a medical student, and a patient came to the hospital with a heart attack, things were mostly up to God. Today, there's a better than 95 percent chance to survive. Now that all comes from research.\nThe unfortunate things is that there are people, even some scientists, who look at the money that goes to NASA and say, you know, we could use that money to support out work. That's very shortsighted. The more research that's done in any area of science, the better off everyone is going to be. The more that's done in physics, the better off I am in cardiology. There's no better investment for a society than research.	2025-07-02 10:16:32.87574+00	843	6

1798	Look, we're Americans: optimistic, addicted to the quick fix, constantly on the hunt for the new and exotic. It's much easier for us to accept a guy with a big white beard hawking his own custom blend of saw palmetto and squirrel dandruff that it is to hear a real doctor telling us to lay off the big macs, and get off our fat asses and take a walk every decade or so.	2025-07-02 10:16:37.956056+00	518	7

1814	I wanted so badly to lie down next to her on the couch, to wrap my arms around her and sleep. Not fuck, like in those movies. Not even have sex. Just sleep together in the most innocent sense of the phrase. But I lacked the courage and she had a boyfriend and I was gawky and she was gorgeous and I was hopelessly boring and she was endlessly fascinating. So I walked back to my room and collapsed on the bottom bunk, thinking that if people were rain, I was a drizzle and she was a hurricane.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.035328+00	938	8
1815	I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.056285+00	938	8
1816	Grief is a most peculiar thing; were so helpless in the face of it. Its like a window that will simply open of its own accord. The room grows cold, and we can do nothing but shiver. But it opens a little less each time, and a little less; and one day we wonder what has become of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.081261+00	939	8
1817	To me, heaven is where I put a person who I love dearly, who is kind, who is generous, who made a difference in my life and other people's lives.

1822	Time is your most precious gift because you only have a set amount of it. You can make more money, but you can't make more time. When you give someone your time, you are giving them a portion of your life that you'll never get back. Your time is your life. That is why the greatest gift you can give someone is your time.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.232334+00	944	8

1826	Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become. A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she used to be. But a great artist--a master--and that is what Auguste Rodin was--can look at an old woman, portray her exactly as she is . . . and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be . . . and more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, or even you, see that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but simply prisoned inside her ruined body.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.323498+00	947	8

1828	When someone you love dies, and you're not expecting it, you don't lose her all at once; you lose her in pieces over a long timethe way the mail stops coming, and her scent fades from the pillows and even from the clothes in her closet and drawers. Gradually, you accumulate the parts of her that are gone. Just when the day comeswhen there's a particular missing part that overwhelms you with the feeling that she's gone, foreverthere comes another day, and another specifically missing part.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.386179+00	948	8

1830	Do not stand at my grave and weep,\nI am not there; I do not sleep.\nI am a thousand winds that blow,\nI am the diamond glints on snow,\nI am the sun on ripened grain,\nI am the gentle autumn rain.\nWhen you awaken in the mornings hush\nI am the swift uplifting rush\nOf quiet birds in circling flight.\nI am the soft starlight at night.\nDo not stand at my grave and cry,\nI am not there; I did not die.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.44425+00	950	8

1836	The unhappy person resents it when you try to cheer him up, because that means he has to stop dwelling on himself and start paying attention to the universe. Unhappiness is the ultimate form of self-indulgence. When you're unhappy, you get to pay a lot of attention to yourself. You get to take yourself oh so very seriously.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.578229+00	496	8

1838	Once, an elderly general practitioner consulted me because of his severe depression. He could not overcome the loss of his wife who had died two years before and whom he had loved above all else. Now, how can I help him? What should I tell him? Well, I refrained from telling him anything but instead confronted him with the question, "What would have happened, Doctor, if you had died first, and your wife would have had to survive you?" "Oh," he said, "for her this would have been terrible; how she would have suffered!" Whereupon I replied, "You see, Doctor, such a suffering has been spared her, and it was you who have spared her this suffering  to be sure, at the price that now you have to survive and mourn her." He said no word but shook my hand and calmly left my office. In some way, suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.628015+00	629	8
1839	The world is too big for love to be real. There are too many people in the world to ever know, beyond everything, that you are with the right person. That your heart is as swollen as it can be. Think of all the people in China. It is unlikely anyone will ever meet all of them. How can we know for certain, that trapped inside a foreign language and thumping in a foreign heart there isnt a love that is meant for us. The infinite possibility of existence, its limitless potential, is the proof that we need that love is nothing more than an imagination, a human folly, friendship swollen with self-importance, a final retreat from the storm of possibility. The love of our life could so easily have been someone else. It is random and accidental, haphazard and unsystematic. That which we feel for one person, clinging on to the delusion of destiny, could so easily be felt for a million people should the timing and the meetings and the mutual readiness have coalesced at some other time in some other place. Should someone else have accepted us or rejected us then everything would have been different. And once we know this, we know that all love is a lie. Not honesty but deception. Not heroism but cowardice. An unspoken agreement of mutual consolidation and compromise, a shield from possibility and a bed in which to sleep, nothing more than that. But I do still miss her.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.65471+00	951	8
1840	Don't underestimate kindness, gentleness and patience in a man.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.683388+00	952	8
1841	Don't be overwhelmed by a man's fancy car, fancy house or fancy clothes. It's really the person inside the care, house and clothes that matters. By the same token, don't be underwhelmed by a less-than-fancy car, house or clohtes. Women can earn the car and house themselves, and you can always buy your man nice clothes, too.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.703442+00	952	8

1848	My dear, life rarely gives us what we want at the moment we consider appropriate. Adventures do occur, but not punctually.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.856839+00	956	8
1849	Time is very slow for those who wait, very fast for those who are scared, very long for those who lament, very short for those who celebrate. But, for those who love, time is eternity.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.8769+00	62	8
1850	How wrong it is for a woman to expect the man to build the world she wants, rather than to create it herself.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.898221+00	603	8
1851	Denny: What I give to you, what - what I share, I do with no one else. I like to think what you give to me, you do with nobody else. Now that - that may sound silly to you. But here's what I think is silly - the idea that jealousy or fidelity is reserved for romance. I always suspected that there was a connection between you and THAT man. That you got something you didn't get from me.\nAlan: I probably do. But gosh, what I get from you, Denny ... People walk around today calling everyone their "best friend". The term doesn't have any real meaning anymore. Mere acquaintances are lavished with hugs and kisses upon a second or, at most, third meeting. Birthday cards get passed around offices, so everybody can scribble a snippet of sentimentality for a colleague they've barely met. And everyone just "loves" everyone. As a result, when you tell somebody you love them today, it isn't much heard. I love you, Denny. YOU are my best friend. I can't imagine going through life without you as my best friend. Not gonna kiss you, however.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.923623+00	957	8

1853	A heart is not judged by how much you love, but by how much you are loved by others.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.968801+00	958	8
1854	I opened myself to you only to be skinned alive. The more vulnerable I became, the faster and more deft your knife. Knowing what was happening, still I stayed and let you carve more. That's how much I loved you. That's how much.	2025-07-02 10:16:39.994577+00	959	8
1855	It was as if nothing quite erased the initial shock of being kissed by someone who was not hers, a kiss that was stolen, claimed from her flippantly, a kiss so abrasively illicit that she seemed to deserve it, as though she was not worth much to begin with.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.020361+00	960	8
1856	Children leave... and parents stay behind. Still, some things are deeper than time and distance. And your father will always be your father...And he will always leave a light on for you.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.046998+00	961	8

1860	Live to the limits they say. Go all out. Give all. And that's what I'd persevered to do for so many years of my life. But sometimes the beauty, the joy, the enticement, excitement of an act, a word, a feeling, a thought, is in fact, magnified where there is reservation. A speck, a smudge, a splatter, or remnants. And because control is with intention, the knowing of it is even more fragile. Vulnerable. Real. But more so, to give all can be stupidly painful when you ain't ready to take it all in. And it can spillout to those whom you affect. And so, I want love, with a price.\nLove for sale.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.132753+00	\N	8
1861	Funny how we think of romance as always involving two, when the romance of solitude can be ever so much more delicious and intense. Alone, the world offers itself freely to us. To be unmasked, it has no choice.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.151758+00	496	8
1862	When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us. When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more promising. This can go on and on -- series polygamy -- untill we admit that while a partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual failure every relationship we enter.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.17236+00	496	8
1863	The past is a ghost, the future a dream, and all we ever have is now.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.193957+00	963	8

1865	Okay, life's a fact, people do fall in love, people do belong to each other, because that's the only chance anybody's got for real happiness	2025-07-02 10:16:40.239409+00	965	8
1866	You're in my mind all of the time, I know that's not enough.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.259445+00	365	8
1868	Love at first sight is easy to understand; it's when two people have been looking at each other for a lifetime that it becomes a miracle.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.30808+00	967	8
1869	But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangling the grief, until the memory of your loved one is just... poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.331667+00	968	8

1872	Love of all creatures, humankind or kind, needn't always be repaid, reciprocated, or even known.\nBut if you feel something for someone today, do not hold back your emotions. If he or she cannot be in your possession, he or she is without the pain you might give in this, albeit beautiful but crazy dilemma of love, but will be loved by you for as long as you can remember. And to truly be stirred in this strawberry swirl of sweetness, is a moment to be thankful for. To love is the greatest gift of life, and to be loved, always something to be grateful for.\nAnd to proclaim your love for someone, girls, that is something you'd always thank yourself for. That is more courage than the most respectable and romantic guy could ever muster. And if the guy turns out to be a pig about it, step away and smile. Because, thank God, you never had him.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.38537+00	\N	8
1873	"I wish you'd get married," Mrs. Glass said, abruptly, wistfully.  Everyone in the Glass family --- Zooey certainly not least --- was familiar with this sort of nonsequitur from Mrs. Glass.  It bloomed best, most sublimely, in the middle of an emotional flareup of just this kind.  This time, it caught Zooey very much off guard, however.  He gave an explosive sound, mostly through the nose, of either laughter or the opposite of laughter.  Mrs. Glass quickly and anxiously leaned forward to see which it was.  It was laughter, more or less, and she sat back, relieved.  "Well, I do," she insisted.  "Why don't you?"   Relaxing his stance, Zooey took a folded linen handkerchief from his hip pocket, flipped it open, then used it to blow his nose once, twice, three times.  He put away the handkerchief, saying, "I like to ride in trains too much.  You never get to sit next to the window any more when you're married."	2025-07-02 10:16:40.409366+00	969	8
1874	Do you know the most surprising thing about divorce? It doesn't actually kill you. Like a bullet to the heart or a head-on car wreck. It should. When someone you've promised to cherish till death do you part says "I never loved you," it should kill you instantly. You shouldn't have to wake up day after day after that, trying to understand how in the world you didn't know. The light just never went on, you know. I must have known, of course, but I was too scared to see the truth. Then fear just makes you so stupid.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.436153+00	970	8
1875	You teach me now how cruel you've been - cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. Yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears: they'll blight you - they'll damn you. You loved me - then what right had you to leave me? What right - answer me - for the poor fancy you felt for Linton? Because misery and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will, did it. I have not broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong. Do I want to live? What kind of living will it be when you - oh, God! would you like to live with your soul in the grave?	2025-07-02 10:16:40.460022+00	971	8
1876	I know that you can love me, when there's no one left to blame.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.480726+00	417	8
1877	The brain may take advice, but not the heart, and love having no geography, knows no boundaries: weight and sink it deep, no matter, it will rise and find the surface: and why not? Any love is natural and beautiful that lies within a person's nature; only hypocrites would hold a man responsible for what he loves, emotional illiterates and those of righteous envy, who, in their agitated concern, mistake so frequently the arrow pointing to heaven for the one that leads to hell.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.505784+00	972	8
1878	Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I'm gazing at a distant star. It's dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn't even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.530233+00	973	8
1879	It is said there are flowers that bloom only once in a hundred years. Why should there not be some that bloom once in a thousand, in ten thousand years? Perhaps we never know about then simply because this "once in a thousand years" has come today.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.55361+00	974	8
1880	I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my ideas; they've gone through and through me like wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.574482+00	971	8
1881	Perhaps all our loves are merely hints and symbols; vagabond-language scrawled on gate posts and paving-stones along the weary road road that others have trampled before us; perhaps you and I are types and this sadness which sometimes falls between us springs from disappointment in our search, each straining through and beyond the other, snatching a glimpse now and then of the shadow which turns the corner always a pace ot two ahead of us.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.600585+00	975	8
1882	In love you must... Risk more than others think is safe. Care more than others think is wise. Dream more than others think is practical. Expect more than others think is possible.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.626636+00	976	8
1883	I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.648602+00	458	8
1884	There was such an incredible logic to kissing, such a metal-magnet pull between two people that it was a wonder that they found the strength to prevent themselves from succumbing every second.  Rightfully the world should be a whirlpool of kissing into which we sank and never found the strength to rise up again.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.675432+00	977	8
1885	As thin as the line between love and hate is, you must take every precaution possible in order to prevent their mixing, for whenever one is felt for the other it is a bad thing.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.702283+00	978	8
1886	I'm not a concept. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.725714+00	979	8
1887	There are only four question of any value in this life, Don Octavio; what is sacred, of what is the spirit made, what is worth living for and what is worth dieing for. The answer to each is the same - only love.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.751956+00	980	8

1888	One night when my longing for her was like a fire burning out of control in my heart and my head, I wrote her a letter that just seemed to go on and on. I poured out my whole heart in it, never looking back to see what Id said because I was afraid cowardice would make me stop.  I didnt stop, and when a voice in my head clamored that it would be madness to mail such a letter, that I would be giving her my naked heart to hold in her hand, I ignored it with a childs breathless disregard of the consequences.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.771662+00	471	8
1889	Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love... true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.796136+00	981	8
1890	It's the most terrifying day of your life, the day the first one is born. Your life, as you know it, is gone. Never to return. But they learn how to walk, and they learn how to talk, and you want to be with them. And they turn out to be the most delightful people you'll ever meet in your life.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.820886+00	982	8
1891	Who can tell what metals the gods use in forging the subtle bond which we call sympathy, which we might as well call love.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.843973+00	983	8
1892	Curse on all laws but those which love has made! Love, free as air at sight of human ties, Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.865012+00	281	8
1893	Have you ever had the sensation of looking at someone for the first time and ever so quickly the past and future seem to fuse ? Does that not mean something ? That we felt so much, so deeply, before even speaking?	2025-07-02 10:16:40.891762+00	954	8
1894	You color every light and every sound all my petty emotions turn clear and black and white. I've reached permanent midnight.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.940782+00	984	8
1895	Our lives are fractions of a whole but if the world could remain in a frame like a painting on a wall, then I think we would see the beauty, then we would stand staring in awe at our still lives posed like a bowl of oranges, like a story told by the fault lines and the soil.	2025-07-02 10:16:40.973422+00	985	8
1896	Metaphors are dangerous. Love begins with a metaphor. Which is to say, love begins at the point when a woman enters her first word into our poetic memory.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.000074+00	986	8
1897	The most called-upon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.020309+00	586	8
1898	Perhaps we all give the best of our hearts, uncritically--to those who hardly think of us in return.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.043487+00	987	8
1899	What makes something special is not just what you have to gain, but what you feel there is to lose.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.067016+00	988	8
1900	Love is not forced. It does not exist because we want it to, or because we make it so, or because we have to. It comes like a arrow on dreadful wings, sweeping down and piercing us when we weren't expecting it, because if we saw it coming we wold have deflected it and beat it away with a vengeance. And when it hits us, pierces us, it bleeds us. Leave the arrow in, patch your heart around it, and in time you'll learn to live with love. The arrow. Pull it out, and every day you'll bleed a little harder, and die a little more.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.08464+00	\N	8

1903	Passion gives us our greatest moments, the joy of love, the clarity of hatred, the ecstasy of grief.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.141803+00	\N	8
1904	If I could die and come back as anything, it would be as one of your tears.  What more would I want than to be conceived in your heart, born in your eyes, live on your cheeks and die on your lips?	2025-07-02 10:16:41.163509+00	\N	8
1905	The more sensitive you are, the more likely you are to be brutalised, develop scabs, never evolve. Never allow yourself to feel anything, because you always feel too much.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.187563+00	989	8
1906	I don't compare my relationships to song lyrics for the simple fact that most true "love" songs create a vision of utopia, a sense of perfection... and in reality, true love isn't about perfection, but rather imperfection.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.208609+00	990	8
1907	Women, aren't they perfect? It doesn't matter if they're fat, skinny, blond, or blue. If a woman is willing to give you her love, Harvard, it's the greatest gift in the world. Makes you taller, makes you smarter, makes your teeth shine. Boy-oh-boy women are perfect, perfect joy and perfect ache. Joy when you first meet them and get to know them. Ache when you leave them. Joy. Ache. Joy. Ache. Joyachejoyachejoyachejoyache.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.231149+00	991	8
1908	What I want is to be needed. What I need is to be indispensable to somebody.  Who I need is somebody that will eat up all my free time, my ego, my attention.  Somebody addicted to me.  A mutual addiction.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.248676+00	497	8
1909	Hold tenderly that which you cherish, for it is precious and a tight grip may crush it. Do not let the fear of dropping it cause you to hold it too tightly: the chances are, it's holding you, too.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.270033+00	992	8
1910	A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer; it sings because it has a song.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.290184+00	586	8
1911	On who the flies landed without being chased away by that person, was on her way to death - this was one of the unmistakeable signs. From that time on, I think, dates my obsession with flies. In times of peace, when we all lied still, I made sure to sneak close up to my mother, watching very carefully that no fly would land on her, - I waved my hat over her body, flies don't like wind and movement...	2025-07-02 10:16:41.313875+00	993	8
1912	Anybody can sympathize with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathize with a friends success.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.333793+00	55	8
1913	They've promised that dreams can come true - but forget to mention that nightmares are dreams, too.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.351943+00	\N	8
1914	A woman should marry the man who loves her, but never the one that she loves; that is the secret of lasting happiness.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.373892+00	994	8
1915	All that is gold does not glitter; not all those that wander are lost.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.393929+00	509	8
1916	There are two types of compassion. One - is faint-hearted and sentimental. Actually, it is nothing more than impatience of the heart, that is hurrying to get rid of that hard feeling when you see other peoples' sufferings; this is not a compassion, but just an instinct will to defence yourself from misfortunes of others. But there is another compassion - real one, that demands for actions, not sentiments, it knows what it wants, and it is full of determination to do everything, what is in human power and even beyond it.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.417263+00	995	8

1917	...after a while, you realise that it's such a waste of time and effort to be continually on the look-out for Miss Perfect. We can reap better returns by concentrating on making our current relationships work.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.439669+00	996	8
1918	When you love someone, you give them part of your heart, and at that moment, your heart is broken.  It is ironic that you can't feel the pain until they give you back that piece of your heart and you try to put it back together again.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.456914+00	\N	8
1919	Friendship is always a sweet responsibility, never an opportunity.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.474921+00	844	8
1920	I don't love women. Love has to be reinvented, we know that. The only thing women can ultimately imagine is security. Once they get that, love, beauty, everything else goes out the window. All they have left is cold disdain; that's what marriages live on nowadays. Sometimes I see women who ought to be happy, with whom I could have found companionship, already swallowed up by brutes with as much feeling as an old log....	2025-07-02 10:16:41.498795+00	997	8
1921	"Just living isn't enough," said the butterfly, "one must also have freedom, sunshine, and a little flower."	2025-07-02 10:16:41.515755+00	\N	8
1922	Though no one can go back and make a brand new start, anyone can start from now and make a brand new ending.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.538574+00	998	8
1923	That it will never come again is what makes life so sweet.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.562749+00	999	8
1924	Look at my eyes, Faye. One of them is a fake because I lost it in an accident. Since then, I've been seeing the past in one eye and the present in the other. So, I thought I could only see patches of reality, never the whole picture. I felt like I was watching a dream I could never wake up from. Before I knew it... the dream was over.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.584672+00	1000	8
1925	The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.602949+00	844	8
1926	A dreamer born is a hero bred...	2025-07-02 10:16:41.626318+00	1001	8
1927	It's sad that you can't put your arms around memories.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.643108+00	\N	8
1928	The man flew in red summer and she handed him whispers for a castle. The night owls have peace and sadness on their watch, but  he worships her lies and thinks it is for the best.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.664615+00	1002	8
1929	In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once, and never again, no matter how many lifetimes you live.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.687462+00	1003	8
1930	It's not the wrong guys that can hurt you, only the right ones.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.705305+00	\N	8
1931	What if you slept? And what if, in your sleep, you dreamed? And what if, in your dream, you went to heaven and there plucked a strange and beautiful flower? And what if, when you awoke, you had the flower in your hand? Ah, what  then?	2025-07-02 10:16:41.730091+00	1004	8
1932	"You see," he says to the girl, "you closed your eyes.  That was the difference. Sometimes you cannot believe what you see, you have to believe what you feel.  And if you are ever going to have other people trust you, you must feel that you can trust them, too-even when you're in the dark. Even when you're falling."	2025-07-02 10:16:41.752179+00	1005	8

1936	If loving you is wrong, then I'll just like you a whole bunch!	2025-07-02 10:16:41.837392+00	847	8
1937	A kiss can be a comma, a question mark or an exclamation point. That's basic spelling that every woman ought to know.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.86092+00	1009	8
1938	When you're in love, it's the most glorious two-and-a-half minutes of your life.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.883779+00	1010	8
1939	Jason, the night roars into my ears now... can you hear it?	2025-07-02 10:16:41.901051+00	\N	8
1940	People travel to wonder at the height of the mountains, at the huge waves of the seas, at the long course of the rivers, at the vast compass of the ocean, at the circular motion of the stars, and yet they pass by themselves without wondering.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.927628+00	1011	8
1941	O You whom I often and silently come where you are, that I may be with you;\nAs I walk by your side, or sit near, or remain in the same room with you,\nLittle you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is playing within me.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.948774+00	341	8
1942	I want to crawl into a world of pillows with you, and just be.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.966144+00	\N	8
1943	The honorary duty of a human being is to love.	2025-07-02 10:16:41.984846+00	586	8
1944	You said that this is crazy, you're half a world away. And I'm sittin' there and I'm thinkin' but I didn't know what to say. So I said something I can't touch, I always want way too much anyway.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.008676+00	1012	8
1945	When you learn how to live, you learn how to die.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.028191+00	1005	8

1947	Music is like painting in sound. You take it into your inner heart and never lose it. It's eternally mysterious.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.071644+00	1014	8
1948	Natasha, to love is to suffer. To avoid suffering, one must not love. But, then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy, then, is to suffer, but suffering makes one unhappy, therefore, to be unhappy one must love, or love to suffer, or suffer from too much happiness, I hope you're getting this down.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.091064+00	138	8

1952	Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.179253+00	72	8
1953	Deeds cannot dream what dreams can do.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.197265+00	541	8
1954	I believe that imagination is stronger than knowledge\nThat myth is more potent than history\nI believe that dreams are more powerful than facts -\nThat hope always triumphs over experience -\nThat laughter is the only cure for grief\nAnd I believe that love is stronger than death.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.219516+00	1017	8
1955	The day we lose our need for dreams is the day the human race forfeits its soul.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.240798+00	1018	8
1995	To love a person, I think the thing that only matter is try to make her/him happy.\nGetting love from him/her is not as important as that...	2025-07-02 10:16:43.049788+00	\N	8
1956	"... they think that I'm strange... they say that I'm a dreamer... but I don't complain, though I don't have much to call my own. I know a place where I keep the best of things. I'm not gonna wait for my piece of heaven where there's a road, it leads to the promised land. I just turn the key, the key to the kingdom."	2025-07-02 10:16:42.262974+00	1019	8
1957	You say that I have no power? Perhaps you speak truly... But you say that Dreams have no power here? Tell me... what power would hell have if those here imprisoned were not able to dream of heaven?	2025-07-02 10:16:42.285559+00	1020	8
1958	The power of the dream, the faith in things unseen. The courage to embrace your fear. No matter where you are, to reach for your own star... to realize the power of the dream.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.307241+00	1021	8
1959	Destiny is not a matter of chance, but of choice, not something to wish for, but to attain.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.329364+00	1022	8
1960	Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.348121+00	1006	8
1961	Dreams are true while they last and do we not live in dreams?	2025-07-02 10:16:42.365031+00	825	8
1962	Remember that the beauty of any dream is in never letting it go.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.387771+00	1023	8
1963	The most wonderful of all things in life, I believe, is the discovery of another human being with whom one's relationship has a glowing depth, beauty, and joy as the years increase. This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing, it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it. It is a sort of Divine accident.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.41011+00	1024	8
1964	There are many ways to love someone. Sometimes we want love so much, we're not too choosy about who we love. Other times, we make love such a pure and noble thing, no poor human can ever meet our vision. But for the most part, love is a recognition, an opportunity to say, "There is something about you I cherish." It doesn't entail marriage, or even physical love. There's love of parents, love of city or nation, love of life, and love of people. All different, all love.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.432492+00	1025	8
1965	Happiness, that grand mistress of the ceremonies in the dance of life, impels us through all its mazes and meanderings, but leads none of us by the same route.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.45107+00	531	8
1966	Love doesn't make the world go 'round. Love is what makes the ride worthwhile.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.476715+00	1026	8
1967	Talk not of wasted affection; affection never was wasted.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.501907+00	266	8
1968	Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart... Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.526205+00	114	8
1969	In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.545316+00	569	8
1970	Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.561241+00	\N	8
1971	Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss you'll end up in the stars.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.581324+00	1027	8
1972	To laugh often and love much, to win the respect of intelligent persons and the affection of children; to earn the approbation of honest critics; to appreciate beauty; to give of one's self; to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived - that is to have succeeded.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.598505+00	769	8
1973	A man is not old until regrets take the place of dreams.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.615957+00	554	8
1974	No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.633745+00	277	8
1975	At the beginning and at the end of love, the two lovers are embarrassed to find themselves alone.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.655742+00	1028	8
1976	No cord or cable can draw so forcibly, or bind so fast, as love can do with a single thread.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.674034+00	207	8
1977	The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.69674+00	1029	8
1978	Tomorrow night is nothing but one long sleepless wrestle with yesterday's omissions and regrets.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.716326+00	1030	8
1979	Absence sharpens love, presence strengthens it.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.734775+00	908	8
1980	He only earns his freedom and his life, who takes them every day by storm.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.75129+00	147	8
1981	You ask whether I have ever been in love: fool as I am, I am not such a fool as that. But if one is only to talk from first-hand experience, conversation would be a very poor business. But though I have no personal experience of the things they call love, I have what is better - the experience of Sappho, of Euripides, of Catallus, of Shakespeare, of Spenser, of Austen, of Bronte, of anyone else I have read.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.768267+00	44	8
1982	All that we see or seem, is but a dream within a dream.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.786189+00	46	8
1983	It is better, I submit, to believe in something passionately even if it is wrong, than to believe in nothing at all.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.807665+00	1031	8
1984	Life is both sad and solemn. We are let into a wonderful world, we meet one another here, greet each other - and wander together for a brief moment. Then we lose each other and disappear as suddenly and unreasonably as we arrived.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.823179+00	\N	8
1985	What is life? A madness. What is life? An illusion, a shadow, a story, and the greatest good is little enough, for all life is a dream...	2025-07-02 10:16:42.845483+00	1032	8
1986	Once I dreamed I was a butterfly, and now I no longer know whether I am Chuang Tzu, who dreamed I was a butterfly, or whether I am a butterfly dreaming that I am Chuang Tzu.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.866725+00	1033	8
1987	When I consider this carefully, I find not a single property which with certainty separates the waking state from the dream. How can you be certain that your whole life is not a dream?	2025-07-02 10:16:42.883982+00	643	8
1988	Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.902438+00	724	8

1990	I've looked at life from both sides now\nFrom win and lose, and still somehow\nIt's life's illusions I recall\nI really don't know life at all	2025-07-02 10:16:42.949697+00	1035	8
1991	No one feels another's grief, no one understands another's joy. People imagine that they can reach one another. In reality they only pass each other by.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.971543+00	1036	8
1992	One man scorned and covered with scars still strive with his last ounce of courage to reach the unreachable stars; and the world will be better for this.	2025-07-02 10:16:42.988744+00	\N	8
1993	Young love is a flame; very pretty, often very hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering.\nThe love of the older and disciplined heart is as coals, deep burning, unquenchable.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.01403+00	1037	8
1997	Visualise your dreams\nRecord it in the present tense\nPut it into permanent form\nIf you persist in your efforts, you can achieve\ndream control...	2025-07-02 10:16:43.094462+00	363	8
1998	When all of your wishes are granted, many of your dreams will be destroyed.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.113776+00	139	8
1999	Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations. I may not reach them, but I can look up and see their beauty, believe in them and try to follow where they may lead.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.136905+00	1039	8

2002	There are mysteries about our love. Things that neither one of us may ever understand because love is an emotion without limit and understanding. We know we love each other but we could never explain completely as WHY we love each other. Love is not a clock. You simply cannot take it apart just to see what makes it tick, and even if you could, you probably could never get it back together again.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.206811+00	\N	8
2003	Love is an attachment to another self. Humour is a form of self-detachment - a way of looking at one's existence, one's misfortune or one's discomfort. If you really love, if you really know how to laugh, the result is the same: you forget yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.231944+00	1042	8
2004	Before holding another in any other way, you should first hold them in your heart. Love and affection start there, and everything else that is really important comes from that point.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.257065+00	1043	8
2005	If I died\nWho would care?\nNo friend in the world,\nNobody there.\nNobody knows\nThe pain that I hide.\nNobody knows\nHow I feel inside.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.281622+00	1044	8
2006	I hope this match never ends. When the match ends, the memories begin.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.305081+00	1045	8
2007	I have learned this at least by my experiment: if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.326707+00	95	8
2008	In the dark of the moon, we have our dreams to light the path.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.346563+00	\N	8
2009	Regret can be deepest when you just stay silent.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.364419+00	\N	8
2010	Remember that you don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.39074+00	1046	8
2011	A boy's will is the wind's will,\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.407442+00	266	8

2013	I remember little things that break my heart. We were coming out of Michael's house one day, and he noticed my shoelaces were undone. He bent down and tied them. I almost cried. To me, it was such a gesture of love.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.450586+00	1048	8
2014	Friendship often ends in love; but love in friendship - never.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.467196+00	531	8
2015	Love lasts when the relationship comes first.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.482558+00	\N	8
2016	The best way to predict your future is to create it!	2025-07-02 10:16:43.497953+00	\N	8
2017	And in the end it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.514843+00	306	8
2018	We must laugh before we are happy, for fear we die before we laugh at all.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.536296+00	1049	8

2020	Love is like quicksilver in the hand. Leave the fingers open and it stays. Clutch it, and it darts away.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.583158+00	1051	8
2021	No one can predict to what heights you can soar, Even you will not know until you spread your wings.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.601018+00	\N	8

2026	I have never met a person whose greatest need was anything other than real, unconditional love. You can find it in a simple act of kindness toward someone who needs help. There is no mistaking love. You feel it in your heart. It is the common fiber of life, the flame that heals our soul, energizes our spirit and supplies passion to our lives. It is our connection to God and to each other.	2025-07-02 10:16:43.703217+00	1053	8
2027	It is a good idea to be ambitious, to have goals, to want to be good at what you do, but it is a terrible mistake to let drive and ambition get in the way of treating people with kindness and decency.

2068	[But] maybe what is important doesn't change. I learned this from Bob Haggart, a good friend in my hometown of Syracuse, New York. Bob had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 1988 and was not doing well. He wouldn't live to see the new millennium. I wanted to get his perspective, as someone who knows death is real, about what is important and enduring. But before I could do so, his wife, Brenda, called. Bob was in the hospital. He was too sick to see visitors or to write his regular newspaper column for the Syracuse Post-Standard. Then on Valentine's Day a column by Bob - written on a word processor sneaked into his hospital room by one of his colleagues - appeared in the Post-Standard. "This is my Valentine to Brenda," it reads. "Unfortunately, this Valentine will not look or taste as good as those hearts that grade-school teachers in Kansas helped me cut out and paste on big pieces of red paper. ... So here is my Valentive, composed in my head as Brenda sleeps beside me on my hospital bed. The paper and paste of my Valentine hold straight and true the best words I have ever written in my life. Bob loves Brenda forever." Eleven days later Bob died. I never got to see him or thank him for answering my question. Love endures.	2025-07-02 10:16:44.58148+00	1078	8

2140	In everyone's life, at some time, our inner fire goes out. It is then burst into flame by an encounter with another human being. We should all be thankful for those people who rekindle the inner spirit.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.03926+00	1122	8
2141	Do not the most moving moments of our lives find us without words?	2025-07-02 10:16:46.061021+00	1123	8
2142	Your life would be very empty if you had nothing to regret.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.076585+00	\N	8
2143	One may have a blazing hearth in one's soul and yet no one ever come to sit by it. Passers-by see only a wisp of smoke from the chimney and continue on the way.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.096697+00	1124	8
2144	Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies...	2025-07-02 10:16:46.114651+00	932	8
2145	If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.13108+00	95	8
2146	Every time a friend succeeds, I die a little.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.148253+00	159	8
2147	We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us, but for ours to amuse them.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.163543+00	975	8
2148	True love stories never have endings.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.178481+00	\N	8
2149	"Pooh, promise you won't forget about me, ever. Not even when I'm a hundred."\nPooh thought for a little while. "How old shall I be then?"\n"Ninety-nine."\nPooh nodded. "I promise," he said.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.194725+00	\N	8
2150	Love is a well from which we can drink only as much as we have put in, and the stars that shine from it are only our eyes looking in.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.211911+00	532	8
2151	Love is the Pain you can't refuse.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.232038+00	1125	8
2152	A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.250581+00	55	8
2153	Lovers don't meet somewhere along the way; they are in each other all along.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.268516+00	936	8
2154	When you fall in a dream, sometimes you die, sometimes you wake up, and sometimes you learn to fly.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.285483+00	898	8
2155	A faithful friend is a medicine for life.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.301408+00	\N	8

2157	If loving you is wrong, I don't want to be right.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.341017+00	\N	8
2158	We grow great by dreams. All big men are dreamers. They see things in the soft haze of a spring day or in the red fire of a long winter's evening. Some of us let these great dreams die, but others nourish and protect them; nurse them through bad days till they bring them to the sunshine and light which comes always to those who sincerely hope that their dreams will come true.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.363273+00	1127	8
2159	When you long with all your heart for someone to love you, a madness grows there that shakes all sense from the trees and the water and the earth. And nothing lives for you, except the long deep bitter want. And this is what everyone feels from birth to death.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.386103+00	1128	8
2160	Watching a peaceful death of a human being reminds us of a falling star; one of a million lights in a vast sky that flares up for a brief moment only to disappear into the endless night forever.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.411048+00	1129	8
2161	The mind I love must have wild places, a tangled orchard where dark damsons drop in the heavy grass, an overgrown little wood, the chance of a snake or two, a pool that nobody's fathomed the depth of, and paths threaded with flowers planted by the mind.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.431978+00	1130	8
2162	The true beloveds of this world are in their lover's eyes lilacs opening, ship lights, school bells, a landscape, remembered conversations, friends, a child's Sunday, lost voices, one's favorite suit, autumn and all seasons, memory, yes, it being the earth and water of existence, memory.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.451342+00	972	8
2163	No matter how much a woman loved a man, it would still give her a glow to see him commit suicide for her.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.469925+00	724	8
2164	Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a teardrop.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.485267+00	\N	8
2165	It's strange how death mocks us, that only in death do we cherish [the ones we love].	2025-07-02 10:16:46.505278+00	1131	8
2166	Love is like an hourglass, with the heart filling up as the brain empties.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.527025+00	1132	8
2167	It is said that the lonely eagle flies to the mountain peaks while the lowly ant crawls the ground, but cannot the soul of the ant soar as high as the eagle?	2025-07-02 10:16:46.543588+00	\N	8
2168	Please, Mom and Dad...\nMy hands are small - I don't mean to spill my milk\nMy legs are short - Please slow down so I can keep up with you\nDon't slap my hand when I touch something bright and pretty - I don't understand\nPlease look at me when I talk to you - It lets me know you're really listening\nMy feelings are tender - Don't nag me all day - Let me make mistakes without feeling stupid\nDon't expect the bed I made or the picture I draw to be perfect - Just love me for trying\nRemember I am a child not a small adult - Sometimes I don't understand what you are saying\nI love you so much - Please love me just for being me - Not for the things I can do	2025-07-02 10:16:46.568641+00	1133	8
2169	If a June night could talk, it would probably boast that it invented romance.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.597743+00	1134	8

2172	It takes a minute to have a crush on someone, an hour to like someone and a day to love someone... but it takes a lifetime to really forget someone you have grown to love...	2025-07-02 10:16:46.651111+00	\N	8
2173	You know, a heart can be broken, but it still keeps a-beatin' just the same.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.667027+00	\N	8
2174	Beauty that is unaware of itself is the most beautiful.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.682208+00	\N	8
2175	When love ends, ask yourself, "Is it better to forgive than forget or is it better to forget than forgive?"	2025-07-02 10:16:46.698419+00	\N	8
2176	I would rather have a moment of wonderful than a lifetime of nothing special.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.714527+00	\N	8
2177	I regret not the things I have done, only those I have yet to do.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.736393+00	1135	8
2178	Dream is not a revelation. If a dream affords the dreamer some light on himself, it is not the person with closed eyes who makes the discovery but the person with open eyes lucid enough to fit thoughts together. Dream - a scintillating mirage surrounded by shadows - is essentially poetry.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.757556+00	1136	8
2179	Dreams come true; without that possibility, nature would not incite us to have them.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.777913+00	1137	8

2182	Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these: "It might have been!"	2025-07-02 10:16:46.838988+00	1139	8
2183	If you cry because the sun has gone out of your life, your tears will prevent you from seeing the stars.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.853676+00	\N	8
2184	My only love, sprung from my only hate.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.869491+00	62	8
2185	Love is like playing the piano. First you must learn to play by the rules, then you must forget the rules and play from your heart.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.884253+00	\N	8
2186	Love is something that you can leave behind you when you die. It's that powerful.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.900131+00	\N	8
2187	If only I can love you, for loving me...	2025-07-02 10:16:46.914908+00	\N	8
2188	Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,\nEnwrought with golden and silver light,\nThe blue and the dim and the dark cloths\nOf night and light and the half light,\nI would spread the cloths under your feet:\nBut I, being poor, have only my dreams;\nI have spread my dreams under your feet;\nTread softly because you tread on my dreams.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.936924+00	1140	8
2189	A mighty pain to love it is,\nAnd it is a pain that pain to miss;\nBut of all pains the greatest pain,\nIt is to love, but love in vain...	2025-07-02 10:16:46.958018+00	1141	8
2190	Don't marry the person you think you can live with; marry only the individual you think you can't live without.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.978961+00	1142	8
2191	There must be such a thing as a child with average ability, but you can't find a parent who will admit that it is his child... Start a program for gifted children, and every parent demands that his child be enrolled.	2025-07-02 10:16:46.9987+00	1143	8
2192	Likely as not, the child you can do the least with will do the most to make you proud.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.018462+00	1144	8
2193	Children need love, especially when they do not deserve it.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.039408+00	1145	8
2194	The last day of school before summer vacation is the shortest day of a mother's year.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.060881+00	1146	8
2195	Beauty is eternity gazing at itself in a mirror.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.078861+00	844	8
2196	I always knew that looking back at my tears would make me laugh, but I never thought that looking back at my laughter would make me cry.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.099926+00	1147	8
2197	I was born when you kissed me, and I died when you left me, but I lived for the two weeks you loved me.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.11609+00	\N	8
2198	If you want to make your dreams come true, the first thing you have to do is wake up.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.132789+00	\N	8
2199	Lost in you, I found myself.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.1543+00	1148	8
2200	Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you\nSweet dreams that leave all worries behind you\nBut in your dreams whatever they be\nDream a little dream of me.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.175772+00	1149	8
2201	Women would be more charming if one could fall into her arms without falling into her hands.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.194123+00	63	8
2202	Sometimes, after you've tried everything, breaking up is the best thing to do.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.210903+00	\N	8
2203	Were we too strong to let our love die or were we just too weak to kill it?	2025-07-02 10:16:47.227271+00	\N	8
2204	If we think of love as in itself the answer to all the problems human beings face, we will constantly be disappointed by it. If we search for perfection in a mate and refuse to be satisfied by anything less than that, we will never really experience sexual or marital love. If we are unwilling to undergo the interpersonal negotiations...we will never be able to give our love to anyone. Since love does not simply happen, as I have been suggesting, it must emerge as the saving remnant of our endless yearning for happy and meaningful lives.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.247686+00	1150	8
2205	Love is not obedience, conformity, or submission. It is a counterfeit love that is contingent upon authority, punishment, or reward. True love is respect and admiration, compassion and kindness, freely given by a healthy, unafraid human being.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.265596+00	575	8
2206	Love is growing old together, contentedly. Sharing a sunset as you've shared your lives. Happy that your worlds are entwined.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.286795+00	1151	8
2207	There are many kinds of love, each satisfying in its own way...\nThe love of beginnings and of passion, gradually replaced by the steady knowing that another wants to be by your side year in, year out, come what may... the love that you feel when holding your baby in your arms, nuzzling her hair, kissing his neck, knowing it all turned out right when she grows up, when he's taller than you, and being with them all gives you incredible joy... the love for the sweet, soft cats who fill your house and your arms when the nest is empty and your heart is heavy. Love is all of that, and more...	2025-07-02 10:16:47.308988+00	1152	8
2208	She has fallen asleep\nI cradle her in my arms\nAnd watch the soft rain	2025-07-02 10:16:47.333565+00	1153	8
2209	I've always believed that you shouldn't want to mend a broken heart, because that's someone you don't want to forget. Scars can be good.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.353655+00	1154	8
2210	If I knew that, I'd fall in love over and over again. Hearts aren't supposed to be mended. If you fall in love and it doesn't work out, you get a broken heart. What comes out of that will make you a better lover and partner next time.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.376238+00	1155	8
2211	The end of wisdom is to dream high enough to lose the dream in the seeking of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.39493+00	1030	8
2212	The only reward for love is the experience of loving.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.416428+00	1156	8
2213	Is that love I see in your eyes, or merely a reflection of mine?	2025-07-02 10:16:47.431283+00	\N	8
2214	I walk alone, assaulted it seems, by tears from heaven.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.451061+00	1157	8
2215	It is important that man dreams, but it is perhaps equally important that he can laugh at his own dreams.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.472162+00	1158	8
2216	A man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer, and attempting a task he cannot achieve.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.490152+00	149	8
2217	Whomever said "It is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all", never lost.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.504658+00	\N	8
2265	To the degree we're not living our dreams, our comfort zone has more control of us than we have over ourselves.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.44574+00	1184	8
2266	A friend is the little prize in the cereal box of life.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.463812+00	\N	8
2218	You've been in love with someone for a decade - someone who barely knows you're alive. You've done everything, tried everything to make this person see that you're a valuable, estimable person, and that your love is worth something. Then one day you open the paper and glance at the Personals column, and there you see that your loved one has placed an ad... seeking someone worthwhile to love and be loved by.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.5251+00	1159	8
2219	I know that if I had had a chance to take possession of your soul, I would have made it smile.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.54606+00	1160	8
2220	Do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love him and not hear him say it back?	2025-07-02 10:16:47.568005+00	1161	8
2221	A man never knows how to say goodbye; a woman never knows when to say it.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.590433+00	1162	8
2222	To the lover the loved one always appears as solitary.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.611085+00	1163	8
2223	A short absence quickens love, a long absence kills it.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.63188+00	1164	8
2224	It is very hard to be in love with someone who no longer loves you, but it is far worse to be loved by someone with whom you are no longer in love.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.652136+00	1165	8
2225	It is seldom indeed that one parts on good terms, because if one were on good terms one would not part.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.674515+00	1166	8
2226	Grow old along with me, the best is yet to be.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.695457+00	1167	8
2227	To love oneself is the beginning of a life-long romance.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.712324+00	55	8
2228	The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it you and you alone make me feel that I am alive... Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.735155+00	1168	8
2229	We live in a rainbow of chaos.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.757238+00	1169	8

2231	Some of us think holding on makes us strong, but sometimes it's letting go.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.795197+00	30	8
2232	If equal affection cannot be, then let the more loving be me.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.812404+00	\N	8
2233	You wrote me a beautiful letter, I wonder if you meant it to be as beautiful as it was. I think you did; for somehow I know that your feeling for me, however slight it is, is of the nature of love... When you tell me to come, I will come, by the next train, just as I am. This is not meekness, be assured; I do not come naturally by meekness; know that it is a proud surrender to You.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.834044+00	1170	8
2234	My old dreams were good dreams that didn't come true but I am glad I had them.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.850837+00	\N	8
2235	If this is a crush, then I don't know if I could take if the real thing ever happened.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.873484+00	1171	8
2236	Everytime she sneezes I believe it's love.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.892602+00	359	8
2237	...at times I almost dream\nI too have spent a life the sages' way,\nAnd tread once more familiar paths. Perchance\nI perished in an arrogant self-reliance\nAges ago; and in that act, a prayer\nFor one more chance went up so earnest, so\nInstinct with better light let in by death,\nThat life was blotted out-not so completely\nBut scattered wrecks enough of it remain,\nDim memories, as now, when once more seems\nThe goal in sight again...	2025-07-02 10:16:47.910525+00	1167	8
2238	An emotion as much tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact that something makes you feel something.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.929926+00	135	8
2239	I don't know what's worse, finding the love of your life and losing them - or never knowing if you will.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.950928+00	1172	8
2240	If I could reach up and hold a star for every time you've made me smile, the entire evening sky would be in the palm of my hand.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.966744+00	\N	8
2241	To me, there is no greater act of courage than being the one who kisses first.	2025-07-02 10:16:47.986927+00	1173	8
2242	Do you promise to love me the rest of my life?\nNo, I'll love you the rest of mine.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.003362+00	\N	8

2247	The story of life is quicker than the blink of an eye. The story of love is hello and goodbye, until we meet again.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.098301+00	345	8
2248	... Him that I love, I wish to be free - even from me.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.120369+00	1176	8

2262	I've been to all parts of this grand world and have seen no great tragedy than the heart that loves and sees it not returned. The tragedy, of course, is for both parties.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.389212+00	1183	8

2270	The true trial of a dream is its translation into truth. Passions can fade, dreams can become hazed. Attention must be paid.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.549728+00	1186	8

2272	Suddenly, quietly, you realize that - from this moment forth - you will no longer walk through this life alone. Like a new sun this awareness arises within you, freeing you from fear, opening your life. It is the beginning of love, and the end of all that came before.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.591956+00	70	8
2273	Your life and my life flow into each other as wave flows into wave, and unless there is peace and joy and freedom for you, there can be no real peace or joy or freedom for me. To see reality--not as we expect it to be but as it is--is to see that unless we live for each other and in and through each other, we do not really live very satisfactorily; that there can really be life only where there really is, in just this sense, love.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.613085+00	1188	8

2277	When I see you a blanket of stars covers me in my bed.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.69682+00	359	8
2278	They call them fools, who are unable to resist the slightest chance love might exist.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.717776+00	1192	8
2279	When I told you I loved you, I meant it, but only because I wanted to please you. When I touched you, and my eyes told you I loved you, I meant it because I'm bad at lying.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.741424+00	1193	8
2280	Poetry is an impish attempt to paint the color of the wind.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.759997+00	\N	8

2287	One of the most adventurous things left is to go to bed. For no one can lay a hand on our dreams.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.895861+00	1197	8
2288	It's funny, isn't it, how you can be surrounded by people and be lonely. Yet one person can bring infinite contentment.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.918582+00	1198	8

2291	One must never attempt to explain love, for in doing so, he undermines what love is all about -- unquestioned devotion.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.980086+00	1201	8
2292	And all my days are trances,\nAnd all my nightly dreams\nAre where thy dark eye glances,\nAnd where thy footstep gleams\nIn what ethereal dances\nBy what eternal streams.	2025-07-02 10:16:48.99806+00	46	8
2293	Men often do things for women that they don't want to do, so that women will do things for men that\nthey\ndon't want to do.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.018815+00	1202	8
2294	The one that loves the least controls the relationship.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.038988+00	1203	8

2296	When I met you, I was afraid to like you; When I liked you, I was afraid to kiss you; When I kissed you I was afraid to love you; Now I love you and I'm afraid to lose you.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.070156+00	\N	8
2297	If I give you my idea and you give me yours, then we each have two ideas, and together we have four.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.091808+00	1204	8
2298	Lots of people are willing to die for the person they love, which is a pity, for it is a much grander thing to live for that person.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.114341+00	1205	8

2300	I don't know what it is about you that opens and closes. Only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.148985+00	541	8
2301	Belly to the sun\na hand on the small of your back\nof me, this remains	2025-07-02 10:16:49.167209+00	757	8
2302	There is an insistence throughout on the right to dream, the right to paint the grass blue, the right to reach up to the stars which is impossible in a photographic facsimile of nature.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.182068+00	\N	8
2303	There are only two people who can tell you the truth about yourself: an enemy who has lost his temper and a friend who loves you dearly.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.202949+00	1207	8

2307	Whoever claimed that love is like a roller coaster, didn't know what they were talking about, because love has no safety belts in case you fall out.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.286873+00	1210	8
2308	She's talking in her sleep, it's keeping me awake, and Anna begins to toss and turn, and every word is nonsense, but I understand.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.304157+00	359	8

2310	The best thing you ever did for me was to help me take life less seriously. It's only life after all.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.348104+00	1212	8
2311	Those who complain the sun has gone out of their world have obviously never danced in the rain.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.364893+00	\N	8
2312	She sees shooting stars and comet tails. She's got heaven in her eyes. She says, "I don't need to be an angel. But I'm nothing if I'm not this high."	2025-07-02 10:16:49.382836+00	359	8

2316	If you live to be a hundred, then I wish to live to be a hundred minus one day, so that I never have to live a day without you.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.458732+00	1214	8
2317	If every time I thought of him I put a rock in my pocket, I'd have him in my heart and the world in pocket.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.474698+00	\N	8
2318	The worst way to miss someone is to have them sitting beside you and knowing you can't have them.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.492039+00	\N	8
2319	Love makes me wish I were young and stupid again.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.5121+00	1215	8
2320	It's the things in common that make relationships enjoyable, but it's the difference that make them interesting.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.532385+00	1216	8
2321	When you dream, there are no rules. People can fly; anything can happen. Sometimes, there's a moment as you're waking, and you become aware of the real world around you; but you're still dreaming. You may think you can fly, but you better not try.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.560618+00	1217	8
2322	Some people meet that somebody that they can never stop loving no matter how hard they try. I wouldn't expect you to understand that or even believe it. But trust me, some loves just don't go away.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.5887+00	1218	8
2323	You can't return to the place you never left.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.607837+00	365	8
2324	Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn't it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up these defenses, you build this whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life. You give them a piece of you. They didn't ask for it. They do something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own any more. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination, not just in the mind. It's a soul hurt, a body hurt... gets inside you and rips you apart pain. I hate love.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.626521+00	898	8

2328	Never let a probem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.701183+00	1119	8
2329	Courtship is exciting and romantic because it thrives on the edge of disaster. It co-exists with the threat that, at any moment, it could fall apart and be lost forever.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.72297+00	1221	8
2330	It's the things in common that make relationships enjoyable, but it's the little difference that make them interesting.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.745375+00	1222	8

2332	In my dream, the Angel shrugged and said, "If we fail this time, it will be a failure of imagination." And then she placed the world gently in the palm of my hand.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.778707+00	\N	8
2333	Do you want me to tell you something subversive? Love is everything it's cracked up to be. That's why people are so cynical about it. It really is worth fighting for, being brave for, risking everything for. And the trouble is, if you don't risk anything, you risk even more.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.798136+00	1223	8
2334	I traveled half a world to forget her, but all I did was miss her.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.817581+00	1224	8
2335	I am forever changed, because of who you are, and what you have meant to me.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.834406+00	1171	8
2336	Hey, I've got a great compliment for you. I might be the only person on the face of the earth that knows you're the greatest woman on earth. I may be the only one who appreciates how you are in every single thing that you do; and how you are with Spencer, Spence, and in every single thought that you have and how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good. I think most people miss that about you. I watch them, how they can watch you bring their food and clear their tables and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive. The fact that I get it, makes me feel good, about me.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.853823+00	230	8
2337	How could I be so immature to think you could replace the missing elements in me. How extremely lazy of me.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.87599+00	1225	8
2338	Death has never been so feared as the day love was born.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.899015+00	1226	8

2340	I believed in love for a while. Now I believe in love kinda like I believe in the lottery. It's always happening to someone else.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.940496+00	\N	8
2341	Anything less than mad, passionate, extraordinary love is a waste of time. There are too many mediocre things in life to deal with, and love shouldn't be one of them.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.962183+00	1228	8
2342	Love is fed by the imagination, by which we become wiser than we know, better than we feel, nobler than we are; by which we can see life as a whole: by which and which alone, we can understand others in their real as in their ideal relations.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.978825+00	55	8
2343	Love truth, but pardon error.	2025-07-02 10:16:49.997575+00	124	8

2345	Certain springs are tapped only when you're alone.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.039304+00	1176	8
2346	My love for him was so exquisitely pure that if we all were capable of giving and receiving such a beautiful gift the world would be a far more brilliant place; I think we'd all be poets.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.06027+00	1230	8
2396	I mean, they say you die twice. One time when you stop breathing and a second time, a bit later on, when somebody says your name for the last time.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.676899+00	1261	9
2413	As long as you know I am waiting, take your time flowers of the spring.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.991928+00	1270	9
2414	I love the autumn for its sense of melancholy seems to strike my need for sadness. There is poetry in the dying of the year and mystery as well.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.012002+00	1271	9

2347	'Do you love me?' I asked him, seemingly out of the blue but in my own mind the question had been rolling off my lips for some time. He just looked at me with his head cocked to one side as if to say 'what on earth do you mean?'. I persisted 'Do you love me? It's a simple question Michael.' He paused, took a deep breath drawing words into his mouth. 'I do, yes. I love you Nathalie.' I think in any other mindset I would have ran into his arms and told him that he'd made me the happiest woman in the world, but it's a funny thing when the delusion wears off and you see someone in their truth for the first time... I was hardened, he was lying, nobody was wrong or right at this point and no matter how many 'I love you's would leave our lips, we had reached our end.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.078978+00	1230	8
2348	Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.099881+00	1231	8
2349	Our love was a kiss attempt of two people wearing glasses. Putting them off didn't come to our minds.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.121547+00	1232	8

2354	No matter how perfect is physical beauty of a girl, if she could trample and not to appreciate the love, she doesn't worth of being loved.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.23138+00	1236	8

2357	Love is like a fire, it crackles and lights up, sometimes burning out immediatly, sometimes never dying... but most of the time it just flames up and then burns nearly out, leaving a single flame, of which you could relight it and keep it going for eternity on. Even the tiniest flame can turn into a wildfire.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.281955+00	\N	8

2362	Why is it better to have loved and lost then never to have loved at all? I don't get it. If you've never loved, you don't know what you're missing.\nIt's only when you've experienced it firsthand that the idea of losing it can seem so intolerably painful, so nauseatingly frightening, surely?\nIgnorance is bliss, as they say.\nFor this reason I believe there should be separate phrases.\n1. "It's better to be in love than never to have loved at all."\n2. "It's better to be hit by a truck than to have loved and lost."	2025-07-02 10:16:50.372672+00	\N	8

2364	I would rather have had one breath of her hair, one kiss of her mouth, one touch of her hand, than an eternity without it. One.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.408974+00	\N	8
2365	I never dreamed cause I always thought that dreaming was for kids, just a childish thing, and I can swear love is just a game that children play but no more than a game, till I met you.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.428715+00	1240	8

2369	If you choose not to return, I will understand. Your absence will be of my own doing. But at the same time my existence will be utterly miserable without you by my side. I will shiver, for you are my warmth - I will be lonely, for you are my friend - I will be lost, for you are my guide. Everything good in me, no matter how small, you discover. I long to see your smile in the morning, to feel your touch in the evening. Please, Kathryn, return and grant me your forgiveness.	2025-07-02 10:16:50.509859+00	1243	8

2373	Whatever you now find weird, ugly, uncomfortable and nasty about a new medium will surely become its signature. CD distortion, the jitteriness of digital video, the crap sound of 8-bit - all of these will be cherished and emulated as soon as they can be avoided. Its the sound of failure: so much modern art is the sound of things going out of control, of a medium pushing to its limits and breaking apart. The distorted guitar sound is the sound of something too loud for the medium supposed to carry it. The blues singer with the cracked voice is the sound of an emotional cry too powerful for the throat that releases it. The excitement of grainy film, of bleached-out black and white, is the excitement of witnessing events too momentous for the medium assigned to record them.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.25789+00	1244	9
2374	You playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightening about shrinking so others won't feel insecure around you. As you let your own light shine, you indirectly give others permission to do the same.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.276556+00	1245	9

2376	One of the comforts of having children is knowing one's youth has not fled, but merely been passed down to a new generation. They say when a parent dies, a child feels his own mortality. But when a child dies, it's immortality that a parent loses.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.317056+00	1247	9
2411	But the more I read... after awhile... I begin to find they were all writing about the same thing, this same dull old here-today-gone-tomorrow scene... Shakespeare, Milton, Matthew Arnold, even Baudelaire, even this cat whoever he was that wrote Beowulf... the same scene for the same reasons and to the same end, whether it was Dante with his pit or Baudelaire with his pot... the same dull old scene...	2025-07-02 10:16:51.949862+00	1268	9
2377	The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.3328+00	161	9
2378	Perhaps when one has come over a long mountainpass, and is hungry, happy, beaten, and sad, and finally humbled, and lonely, perhaps then sunshine is enough.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.351717+00	1248	9

2380	It gets easier. Every day it gets a little easier. But you have to do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.390022+00	1250	9
2381	I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.409567+00	1251	9
2382	The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.428226+00	1252	9

2385	ALAN: Something's happening.\nDENNY: What do you mean?\nALAN: I mean it's getting close, Denny. I can just feel this Roe v. Wade being chipped away at this parental consent law, the judicial by-pass hoops. The wall's coming down, I can feel it.\nDENNY: May I say something? Friend to friend? You pro-choice people, you need Roe v. Wade. You're desperate for it. Not because you're sure of your opinion but because you're not. You need to cling to that ruling as moral validation for a position you're not entirely comfortable with deep down.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.480179+00	\N	9
2386	Some day soon, perhaps in forty years, there will be no one alive who has ever known me. That's when I will be truly dead - when I exist in no one's memory. I thought a lot about how someone very old is the last living individual to have known some person or cluster of people. When that person dies, the whole cluster dies,too, vanishes from the living memory. I wonder who that person will be for me. Whose death will make me truly dead?	2025-07-02 10:16:51.50025+00	1255	9
2387	Everyone who terrifies you is sixty-five percent water. And everyone you love is made of stardust, and I know sometimes you cannot even breathe deeply, and the night sky is no home, and you have cried yourself to sleep enough times that you are down to your last two percent, but nothing is infinite, not even loss. You are made of the sea and the stars, and one day you are going to find yourself again.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.520417+00	1256	9
2388	I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.535443+00	302	9
2389	It is often said that before you die your life passes before your eyes. It is in fact true. It's called living.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.550292+00	823	9
2390	Take death for example. A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary efforts to delay it, and often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet wed find it hard to live without it. Death gives meaning to our lives. It gives importance and value to time. Time would become meaningless if there were too much of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.571018+00	1257	9
2391	A spider lives inside my head\nWho weaves a strange and wondrous web\nOf silken threads and silver strings\nTo catch all sorts of flying things,\nLike crumbs of thoughts and bits of smiles\nAnd specks of dried-up tears,\nAnd dust of dreams that catch and cling\nFor years and years and years...	2025-07-02 10:16:51.590948+00	1258	9
2392	The world is full of fathers, but there are very few men worthy of being called "Daddy" by their child.\nWhen I was a child at sixteen, I was just a child. All sixteen year-olds are just children. As much as we like them to be adults, they are just children. And like all children, they need their mother, and they need their father. All children need their mother and their father. All children are entitled to their mother and their father.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.609478+00	1259	9
2393	sonder - n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your ownpopulated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited crazinessan epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that youll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.624558+00	\N	9
2394	The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company... a church... a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude... I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you... we are in charge of our attitudes.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.643997+00	1260	9
2397	The biggest difference I have found when working photochemically versus digitally on motion pictures is the length of time the takes can last. Broadly, a 1,000ft roll of 35mm film lasts around nine-and-a-half minutes before running out, while a digital tape or recording card or hard drive can last from 40 minutes to over an hour and a half. This translates to a very different rhythm on the floor; the pressure to "cut" to save film is alleviated.\nArchiving digital images is a technological dilemma. The idea of that discovered shoebox of pictures, or wedding album, will not exist digitally in your camera or on your computer or in a "cloud": you should print them. I often feel a photochemical image contains the mass of the subject and dimension; a digital image often feels as if it is mass-less. This could be nostalgia or simply how I learned to see. Others will not have this learning: they will probably never experience a photochemical image. Is this loss a tragedy, a revolution, an evolution? What have we lost, and what have we gained?\nI will miss walking on to a photochemical film set. It has a magic to me. When the director says: "Action", and the film is rolling, it feels like something is at stake. It feels important and intense. In a way, death is present in the rolling of that film  we live, right now  and the director says: "Cut". And that moment in time is captured on film, really.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.696349+00	1262	9
2398	Once there were brook trout in the streams in the mountains. You could see them standing in the amber current where the white edges of their fins wimpled softly in the flow. They smelled of moss in your hand. Polished and muscular and torsional. On their backs were vermiculate patterns that were maps of the world in its becoming. Maps and mazes. Of a thing which could not be put back. Not be made right again. In the deep glens where they lived all things were older than man and they hummed of mystery.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.715467+00	1263	9
2399	The best thing for being sad is to learn something. That is the only thing that never fails. You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one thing for it then  to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it. That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate, never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of regretting.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.733504+00	1264	9
2400	The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever. When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in the particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is "So it goes."	2025-07-02 10:16:51.748095+00	118	9
2401	I no longer needed a reason for my existence, just a reason to live. And imagination, free will, love, humor, fun, music, sports, beer, and pizza are all good enough reasons for living. But living an honest life - for that you need the truth.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.765668+00	453	9
2402	We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively outnumbers the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?	2025-07-02 10:16:51.781564+00	161	9
2403	If your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.797382+00	455	9
2404	I have no right, by anything I do or say, to demean a human being in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him; it is what he thinks of himself. To undermine a man's self-respect is a sin.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.817063+00	1265	9
2405	I'm not an atheist and I don't think I can call myself a pantheist. We are in the position of a little child entering a huge library filled with books in many different languages. The child knows someone must have written those books. It does not know how. The child dimly suspects a mysterious order in the arrangement of the books but doesn't know what it is. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of even the most intelligent human being toward God.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.834046+00	104	9
2406	Courage does not always roar. Sometimes it is a quiet voice at the end of the day, saying... "I will try again tomorrow."	2025-07-02 10:16:51.853845+00	1266	9
2407	If all of us acted in unison as I act individually there would be no wars and no poverty. I have made myself personally responsible for the fate of every human being who has come my way.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.870775+00	603	9
2408	The feeling of awed wonder that science can give us is one of the highest experiences of which the human pysche is capable. It is a deep aesthetic passion to rank with the finest that music and poetry can deliver. It is truly one of the things that makes life worth living and it does so, if anything, more effectively if it convinces us that the time we have for living it is fragile.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.887016+00	161	9
2409	I thought I was going to sneak away tonight. What a glorious night. Every face I see is a memory. It may not be a perfectly perfect memory. Sometimes we had our ups and downs. But we're all together and you're mine for a night. And I'm going to break precedent and tell you my one-candle wish: That you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say, "I don't want anything more."\nSixty-five years. Don't they go by in a blink...	2025-07-02 10:16:51.909312+00	1267	9
2410	A solitary, unused to speaking of what he sees and feels, has mental experiences which are at once more intense and less articulate than those of the gregarious man. They are sluggish, yet more wayward, and never without a melancholy tinge. Sights and impressions which others brush aside with a glance, a light comment, a smile, occupy him more than their due; they sink silently in, they take on meaning, they become experience, emotion, adventure. Solitude gives birth to the original in us, to beauty unfamiliar and perilous - to poetry.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.927674+00	1097	9
2412	I feel so alone sometimes. The night is quiet for me. I'd love to be able to sleep. I'll probably not rest. I have no need for all this. Help me, Lord.	2025-07-02 10:16:51.971233+00	1269	9
2415	Very few people are capable of being independent; it is a privelege of the strong. And whoever tries it, however justified, without having to, proves that he is probably not only strong but bold to the point of complete recklessness. For he walks into a labyrinth; he increases a thousandfold the dangers which are inherent in life anyway. And not the smallest of his dangers is that no one can witness how or where he loses his way, falls into solitude, or is torn to pieces by some troglodytic minotaur of conscience. When such a man perishes, it happens so far from human understanding that other men have no feeling for it, no fellow feeling.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.028557+00	64	9
2416	I'm asked a lot what the best thing about cooking for a living is. And it's this: to be a part of a subculture. To be part of a historical continuum, a secret society with its own language and customs.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.049058+00	1272	9
2417	A human being is part of the whole, called by us Universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest- a kind of optical delusion of consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation, and a foundation for inner security.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.068769+00	104	9
2418	For attractive lips, speak words of kindness. For lovely eyes, seek out the good in people. For a slim figure, share your food with the hungry. For beautiful hair, let a child run his fingers through it once a day. For poise, walk with the knowledge that you never walk alone.\n)	2025-07-02 10:16:52.086965+00	143	9
2419	Strange is our situation here upon earth.  However, there is one thing that we do know.  That man is here for the sake of other men. Above all for those upon whose smile and well being our own happiness depends. And also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.103909+00	104	9
2420	Walking the streets on winter nights kept him warm, despite the cold nocturnal passions of uprising winds.  His footsteps led between trade-marked houses, two up and two down, with digital chimneys like pigs' tits on the rooftops sending up heat and smoke into the cold trough of a windy sky.  Stars hid like snipers, taking aim now and again when clouds gave them a loophole.  Winter was an easy time for him to hide his secrets, for each dark street patted his shoulder and became a friend, and the gaseous eye of each lamp glowed unwinking as he passed.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.126173+00	1273	9
2421	A book no more contains reality than a clock contains time.  A book may measure so-called reality as a clock measures so-called time; a book may create an illusion of reality as a clock creates an illusion of time; a book may be real, just as a clock is real (both more real, perhaps, than those ideas to which they allude); but let's not kid ourselves -- all a clock contains is wheels and springs and all a book contains is sentences.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.143373+00	496	9
2422	Our songs travel the earth.  We sing to one another.  Not a single note is ever lost and no song is original.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.163384+00	1274	9
2423	My candle burns at both ends; It will not last the night; But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends It gives a lovely light!	2025-07-02 10:16:52.185862+00	1275	9
2424	Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them - a mother's approval, a father's nod - are covered by moments of their own accomplishments. It is not until much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.203708+00	1005	9
2425	There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.219881+00	104	9
2426	Human relations are impossible. When they are real they are uncomfortable, and when they are comfortable they are unreal. It was for the journey into solitude that the human soul was created.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.241679+00	1276	9
2427	Life is very short. You have to know what is the single most important thing in your life; stay focused on the mission; everything else is secondary. Don't wait too long for the perfect condition to appear before taking action - there is no such thing as the ideal situation. You create the opportunity and make the most of the talent God has given you. At the end of your life, you want to look back and say, "It's been all worthwhile. I have tried my best."	2025-07-02 10:16:52.26121+00	1277	9
2428	You know the world must be flat, because when people leave town they never come back.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.282553+00	1278	9
2429	Rolling with only the destination in mind leaves the journey behind you.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.304924+00	1279	9
2430	A fellow will remember a lot of things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me. One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on the ferry, and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in, and on it there was a girl waiting to get off. A white dress she had on. She was carrying a white parasol. I only saw her for one second. She didn't see me at all, but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.321766+00	\N	9
2431	His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it not more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred. Later he became conscious of his damaged wings and of their construction and he learned to think and could not fly any more because the love of flight was gone and he could only remember when it had been effortless.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.343217+00	1280	9
2432	The most merciful thing in the world is the inability of the human mind to correlate its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance, in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.363116+00	1252	9
2433	He wondered how he could ever have thought of the planets, even of the Earth, as islands of life and reality floating in a deadly void. Now with a certainty which never after deserted him, he saw the planets - as mere holes or gaps in the living heaven - excluded and rejected wastes of heavy matter and murky air, formed not by addition to, but by subtraction from, the surrounding brightness.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.382882+00	44	9
2434	Perhaps if human desire is said out loud, the urban planes, the prisons, the architectural mirrors will take off, as airplanes do. The black planes will take off into the night air and the night winds, sliding past and behind each other, zooming, turning and turning in the redness of the winds, living, never to return.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.400314+00	490	9
2435	I closed my eyes and listened carefully for the descendants of Sputnik, even now circling the Earth, gravity their only tie to the planet. Lonely metal souls in the unimpeded darkness of space, they meet, pass each other, and part, never to meet again.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.419399+00	973	9
2436	I wander though China. Without ever having boarded a plane. My travels take place here in the Tokoyo subways, in the backseat of a taxi... all of a sudden this city will start to go. In a flash, the buildings will crumble. Over the Tokyo streets will fall my China, like ash, leaching into everything it touches. Slowly, gradually, until nothing remains. No, this isn't a place for me.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.437528+00	973	9
2437	We are changed souls; we don't look at things the same way anymore. For there was once a time when we expected the worst. But then the worst happened, did it not? And so we will never be surprised again.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.45482+00	488	9
2438	Pain. I seem to have an affection, a kind of sweettooth for it. Bolts of lightning, little rivuets of thunder. And I the eye of the storm.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.475943+00	1281	9
2439	When I arise in the morning I am torn by the twin desires to reform the world, and enjoy the world.  This makes it hard to plan the day.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.496043+00	1282	9
2440	If our lives are the sum total of the choices we've made, then we can not change who we are.  But with each new decision, we can determine who we're going to be.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.511265+00	\N	9
2441	A novel is not an allegory. I said as the period was about to come to an end. It is a sensual experience of another world. If you don't enter that world, hold your breath with the characters and become involved in their destiny, you won't be able to empathize, and empathy is at the heart of the novel. This is how you read a novel: you inhale the experience. So start breathing. I just want you to remember this. That is all; class dismissed.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.535416+00	1283	9
2442	Art is no longer snobbish or cowardly. It teaches peasants to use tractors, gives lyrics to young soldiers, designs textiles for factory women's dresses, writes burlesque for factory theatres, does a hundred other useful tasks. Art is as usueful as bread.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.552367+00	1283	9
2443	The most important things are the hardest things to say. They are the things you get ashamed of, because words diminish them - words shrink things that seemed limitless when they were in your head to no more than living size when they're brought out. But it's more than that, isn't it? The most important things lie too close to wherever your secret heart is buried, like landmarks to a treasure your enemies would love to steal away.  And you may make revalations that cost you dearly only to have people look at you in a funny way, not understanding what you've said at all, or why you thought it was so important that you almost cried while you were saying it.  That's the worst, I think. When the secret stays locked within not for want of a teller, but for want of an understanding ear.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.570738+00	471	9
2444	Abstract design is all right- for wall paper or linoleum. But art is the process of evoking pity and terror. What modern artists do is pseudo- intelectual masturbation. Creative art is intercourse, in which the artist renders emotional his audience... Mmm, one does have to learn to look at art. But it's up to the artist to use language that can be understood. Most of these jokers don't want to use a language you and I can learn; they would rather sneer because we 'fail' to see what they are driving at. If anything. Obscurity is the refuge of incompetence.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.591077+00	821	9
2445	Indecision brings delays -- lost days lamenting lost days.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.614863+00	1284	9
2446	There's nothing terribly wrong with feeling lost, so long as that feeling precedes some plan on your part to actually do something about it. Too often a person grows complacent with their disillusionment, perpetually wearing their "discomfort" like a favorite shirt. I can't say I'm very pleased with where my life is just now... but I can't help but look forward to where it's going.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.636848+00	1285	9
2447	The voice of the sea is seductive; never ceasing, whispering, clamoring, murmuring, inviting the soul to wander for a spell in abysses of solitude; to lose itself in mazes of inward contemplation. The voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.656292+00	983	9
2448	In every life, no matter how full or empty ones purse, there is tragedy. It is the one promise life always fulfills. Thus, happiness is a gift, and the trick is not to expect it, but to delight in it when it comes, and to add to other peoples store of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.676075+00	954	9
2449	The popularity of an individual in life often only manifests itself in death.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.699281+00	1286	9
2450	It is often spur-of-the-moment decisions, sometimes made by others, that can change our whole lives.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.718263+00	1286	9
2451	One day your life will flash before your eyes.  Make it worth watching.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.736348+00	\N	9
2452	I guess it's hard for people who are so used to things the way they are - even if they're bad - to change. Cause they kind of give up. And when they do, everybody kind of loses.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.753757+00	\N	9
2453	I look up to an empty sky, not filled with clouds but filled with sky. Amazing then how it can be, full yet empty, like me.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.776996+00	1287	9
2454	Some of us are darkness lovers. We do not dislike the early and late daylight of June, but we cherish the increasing dark of November, which we wrap around ourselves in the prosperous warmth of wood stove, oil and electric blanket. Inside our warmth we fold ourselves, partly tuber, partly bear, in the dark and its cold - around us, outside us, safely away from us. We tuck ourselves up in the comfort of  cold's opposite, warming ourslves by thought of the cold, lighting ourselves by darkness's idea.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.801261+00	1288	9
2455	I am a part of all that I have met, yet all experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world, whose horizon fades forever and forever as I move.  How dull it is to pause, to make an end.  To rust unburnished, not to shine in use!	2025-07-02 10:16:52.819454+00	825	9
2456	There's a widespread notion that children are open, that the truth about their inner selves just seeps out of them. That's all wrong. No one is more covert than a child, and no one has a greater need to be that way. It's a response to a world that's always using a can opener to open them up to see what's inside, wondering whether it ought to be replaced with a more useful sort of preserves.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.839565+00	1289	9
2457	Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps; for he is the only animal that is struck with the differences between what things are and what they ought to be.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.858443+00	738	9
2458	But at times I wondered if I had not come a long way to find that what I really sought was something I had left behind.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.879067+00	1290	9
2459	Own only what you can carry with you; know language, know countries, know people. Let your memory be your travel bag.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.897668+00	1291	9
2460	And so we stayed out in the garden of the old house until we couldn't kick a ball, laughing in the gathering twilight, making the most of the good weather and all the days that were left, our little game watched only by next door's cat, and every star in the heavens.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.919404+00	1292	9
2461	Words often spoil a moment of judgment or excitement; in all great puzzles and wars and movements, there is a moment to speak and a moment to accept with silent dignity.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.941842+00	1293	9
2462	Character cannot be summoned at the moment of crisis if it has been squandered by years of compromise and rationalisation. The only testing ground for the heroic is the mundane. The only preparation for that one profound decision which can change a life, or even a nation, is those hundreds of half-conscious, self-defining, seemingly insignificant decisions made in private. Habit is the daily battleground of character.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.964015+00	1294	9
2463	The conditions of a solitary bird are five: The first, that it flies to the highest point; The Second, that it does not suffer for company, not even of its own kind; The Third, that it aims its beak to the skies; The Fourth, that it does not have a definite color; The Fifth, that it sings very softly.	2025-07-02 10:16:52.986354+00	1295	9
2464	Life isn't about keeping score. It's not about how many people call you and it's not about who you've dated, are dating, or haven't dated at all. It isn't about who you've kissed, what sport you play, or which guy or girl likes you. It's not about your shoes or your hair or the color of your skin or where you live or go to school. In fact, it's not about grades, money, clothes, or colleges that accept you or not. Life isn't about if you have lots of friends, or if you are alone, and it's not about how accepted or unaccepted you are. Life just isn't about that. But life is about who you love and who you hurt. It's about how you feel about yourself. It's about trust, happiness, and compassion. It's about sticking up for your friends and replacing inner hate with love. Life is about avoiding jealousy, overcoming ignorance, and building confidence. It's about what you say and what you mean. It's about seeing people for who they are and not what they have. Most of all, it is about choosing to use your life to touch someone else's in a way that could never have been achieved otherwise. These choices are what life's about.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.004029+00	\N	9
2465	If I hadn't had children, I probably would have had more money and material things. I probably would have gone more places, gotten more sleep, pampered myself more. My life would have been much more boring and predictable.\nAs a result of being a parent, I have laughed harder, cried more often. I have worried more and hurried more. I've had less sleep, but somehow I've had more fun. I've learned more, grown more. My heart has ached harder, and I've loved to a capacity beyond my imagination.\nI've given more of myself, but I've derived more meaning from life.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.02573+00	1296	9
2466	A journal is more than a memory goad. It's therapeutic. The simple act of opening a notebook to put words down stills the crosscurrents of worry, drawing to focus the essential though patterms that best defines us, intersecting those thoughts with the condition of our life at that exact moment. A journal is one of the few anchors the human condition allows us.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.045957+00	1297	9
2467	You don't look back along time but down though it, like water. Sometimes this comes to the surface; sometimes that; sometimes nothing.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.065449+00	1298	9
2468	The rhythm of the water, the sunset over the horizon, and the freedom of the ocean reminds me of how simply beautiful life can be. When you move too fast you can miss the things that mean the most. My love for th ocean reminds me of my love for the snow, and my love for life. So enjoy all that life has to offer.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.087328+00	1299	9
2469	To try to explain something as "I love it" and "It's fun" would be like describing the sunset over the middle of the ocean as "bright and pretty." It's just not that simple.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.104374+00	1299	9
2470	Many people don't realize that shells are what sand is made from. Broken shells thousands upon thousands.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.120642+00	\N	9
2471	It's a beautiful life. One of safe skyline blues, deep shaded greens, and sunsets the hue of orange soda pop. To these colors, add a texture - maybe the soft clay feel of wet sand underfoot. Throw in a harmony of sound - the advance and retreat of a rising tide, and rustling breeze combing a lonely palm. Beauty abounds in hte lanscapes around us. Art lives in the these moments of action. Art lives in these moments of accomplishment of awareness. Live out loud in bright, bold color. Reflect in silence in soft subtle tones. Art is living. Taste, feel, bleed. When life imitates art, every morning is a blank canvas. A chance to paint with broad strokes - all over again. Go out, look around, say nothing and be heard.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.138376+00	\N	9
2472	My feet have been around the world. My Feet have stood on solid ground. My feet have swam through ocean blue. My feet have danced beneath the moon. Although cut scared and bruised my feet continue to push on through in the snow sand and rain getting through the aches and pains longing for another day. My feet would have it no other way.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.162628+00	1300	9
2473	The division of one day from the next must be one of the most profound peculiarities of life on this planet. It is, on the whole, a merciful arrangement. We are not condemned to sustained flights of being, but are constantly refreshed by little holidays from ourselves. We are intermittent creatures, always falling to little ends and rising to little new beginnings. Our soon-tired consciousness is meted out in chapters, and that the world will look quite different tomorrow is, for both our comfort and our discomfort, usually true. How marvelously too night matches sleep, sweet image of it, so neatly apportioned to our need. Angels must wonder at these beings who fall so regularly out of awareness into a fantasm-invested dark. How our frail identities survive these chasms no philosopher has ever been able to explain.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.18466+00	1191	9
2474	There are victories of the soul and spirit. Sometimes, even if you lose, you win.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.208624+00	1301	9
2475	I didn't realise then that so much of being adult is reconciling ourselves with the awkwardness and strangeness of our own feelings. Youth is the time of life lived for some imaginary audience.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.227743+00	488	9
2476	There is in truth no past, only a memory of the past. Blink your eyes, and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them. Therefore the only appropriate state of the mind is surprise. The only appropriate state of the heart is joy. The sky you see now, you have never seen before. The perfect moment is now. Be glad of it.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.248869+00	823	9
2477	The way of life can be beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls -- has barricaded the world with hate -- has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.276429+00	1302	9
2478	We do not want to be beginners. But let us be convinced of the fact that we will never be anything else but beginners all our life.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.308933+00	1303	9
2479	The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand, nor the kindly smile, nor the joy of companionship; it's the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him with his friendship.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.330391+00	141	9
2480	Those who are affected by music can be divided into two classes: those who hear the spiritual meaning, and those who hear the material sound. There are good and evil results in each case.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.346387+00	\N	9
2481	The world told me I wasn't born with wings. That's okay. I'd rather make my own. There is no glory in flying when you're born with wings. True glory is in being born a crawling creature, and creating your own wings and teaching yourself to fly.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.367705+00	1304	9
2482	The strongest person in the world is the one who stands alone.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.384194+00	\N	9
2483	Your life's a solo run, and even the crowd that's cheering you want you to fall over. They love it when you win, but they love it even better when you lose.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.40664+00	1305	9
2484	A pleasure is not full grown until it is remembered.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.424566+00	44	9
2485	Who am I? Who are you? That is to say, "Who are you really?" Do you know? Does anyone know? The restraints of this society make us put up so many walls of bullshit and facades to hide who we are that it is almost impossible to tell who anyone really is. We dig ourselves into a comfortable hole to hide away from the eyes of our peers, and it's in this hole that we bury ourselves. Dig yourselves out. Claw your way back into the light of day. Let your true self breathe, and in doing that, live.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.442445+00	521	9
2486	The only service a friend can really render is to keep up your courage by holding up to you a mirror in which you can see a noble image of yourself.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.46147+00	119	9
2487	Depression may be an exaggerated form of a response to loss that in less extreme form is adaptive. A depressed mood slows us down, makes us think realistically rather than optimistically, makes us turn away from goals that we can no longer hope to achieve, and signals to others that this is a time in life when we need some help.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.481599+00	1306	9
2488	Old mounds of debris beside the road, fallen and broken fir trees behind the house that must have been there for a long time, maybe a year. Years. Tall desiccated weeds were poking through them, suckers and scrawny little trees. You wondered how they survived but of course they did. In the skin were marks just visible through the ice coating, like secret writing, scars. Nor were they dead exactly, these fallen trees. They were alive, only not vertical. The heartbeat inside them had maybe slowed, only a murmur but if you squatted to listen, if you knew how to listen, if the wind would die down you would hear it.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.50187+00	1307	9
2489	There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace--those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.519645+00	644	9
2490	But now I had something I loved and venerated, I had an ideal again. Life was rich with intimations of mystery and a feeling of dawn that made me immune to all taunts.  I had come home again to myself, even if only as the slave and servant of a cherished image.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.540495+00	1308	9

2492	The dark night was the first book of poetry and the constellations were the poems.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.580001+00	1310	9
2493	Nothing's lost forever. In this world, there is a kind of painful progress. Longing for what we've left behind, and dreaming ahead.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.599388+00	1311	9
2494	It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.615998+00	\N	9
2495	Aerodynamically the bumblebee shouldn't be able to fly, but the bumblebee doesn't know that so it goes on flying anyway.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.638511+00	1312	9
2496	My life is nothing but moments, individual moments that can only be truly remembered at that moment.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.653992+00	\N	9
2497	I don't want to sound gloomy, but at some point of your lives every one of you will notice that you have in your life one person, one friend whom you love and care for very much. That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is at the other end of that line. We used to do that with him (Peter Cushing) so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.674402+00	1313	9
2498	Each person's life is lived as a series of conversations.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.69383+00	1314	9
2499	Literature duplicates the experience of living in a way that nothing else can, drawing you so fully into another life that you temporarily forget you have one of your own. That is why you read it, and might even sit up in bed till dawn, throwing your whole tomorrow out of whack, simply to find out what happens to some people who - you know perfectly well - are made up.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.713543+00	1315	9
2500	The marvellous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be so wonderful if there were no dark alleys to transverse.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.732088+00	1316	9
2501	I think that there is only one way to science - or to philosophy, for that matter: to meet a problem, to see its beauty and fall in love with it; to get married to it and to live with it happily, till death do ye part - unless you should meet another and even more fascinating problem or unless, indeed, you should obtain a solution. But even if you do obtain a solution, you may then discover, to your delight, the existence of a whole family of enchanting, though perhaps difficult, problem children, for whose welfare you may work, with a purpose, to the end of your days.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.753895+00	1317	9

2535	Isolation is aloneness that feels forced upon you, like a punishment. Solitude is aloneness you choose and embrace. I think great things can come out of solitude, out of going to a place where all is quiet except the beating of your heart.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.452553+00	1337	9
2590	Most people would rather be certain they're miserable, than risk being happy.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.581709+00	1370	9

2503	Well I believe in the soul... the cock... the pussy... the small of a woman's back... the hangin' curveball... high fiber... good scotch... that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent overrated crap... I believe Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. I believe there ought to be a Constitutional amendment outlawing Astroturf and the designated hitter. I believe in the sweet spot, soft core pornography, opening your presents Christmas morning rather than Christmas Eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last three days. Goodnight.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.794263+00	1318	9
2504	Have you ever wondered why, wondered why the night sky,\nIs always so dark and sinister?\nWith a few clouds here and a few clouds there,\nAnd the moon, with the light it administers.\nMaybe it's the darkness in our souls that fills all hollows and holes,\nDarker than the darkest empty space.\nOr maybe it's just there to see, not to be pondered about by you and me,\nSo let it simply Rest in Peace.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.814117+00	103	9
2505	Peeping through my keyhold I see within the range of only about 30 percent of the light that comes from the sun; the rest is infrared and some little ultraviolet, perfectly apparent to many animals, but invisible to me. A nightmare network of ganglia, charged and firing without my knowledge, cuts and splices what I see, editing it for my brain. Donald E. Carr points out that the sense impressions of one-celled animals are not edited for the brian: 'This is philosophically interesting in a rather mournful way, since it means that only the simplest animals perceive the universe as it is.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.835768+00	1319	9
2506	I dread success. To have succeeded is to have finished one's business on earth, like the male spider, who is killed by the female the moment he has succeeded in his courtship. I like a state of continual becoming, with a goal in front and not behind.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.855403+00	119	9
2507	"Is it true what the old man had said, that everything evil begins with an forgotten longing?"\n"No, it begins even earlier, with a disappointed hope."	2025-07-02 10:16:53.873679+00	\N	9
2508	Books say, "She did this because." Life says, "She did this." Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren't. I'm not surprised that some people prefer books. Books make sense. The only problem is that the lives they make sense of are other people's lives, never your own.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.89684+00	1320	9
2509	The past is but the beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.919983+00	1321	9

2512	Sipping a cup of tea, going for a morning walk, doing your work - all these small activities make up your living. And each part, each moment of living, is meaningful. You just have to be there; otherwise, who is going to experience the meaning? People go on drinking tea, but they never are there; their minds are wandering all over the world.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.973824+00	\N	9
2513	We the willing, led by the unknowing, are doing the impossible, for the ungrateful. We have done so much, for so long, with so little, that we are now qualified to do anything with nothing.	2025-07-02 10:16:53.989801+00	\N	9
2514	The sky is a huge dome of hard material arched over the flat earth. On the outside there is light. In the dome there are a large number of small holes, and through these holes you can see the light from the outside when it's dark. And through these holes the spirits of the dead can pass into the heavenly regions. The way to heaven leads over a narrow bridge which spans an enormous abyss. The spirits that were already in heaven light torches to guide the feet of the new arrivals. These torches are called the northern lights.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.01124+00	1323	9

2517	In describing my experience I am recording not what happened or what exists, but how I perceive it. In doing so I define myself. As I create my diary, I create myself.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.073736+00	1325	9

2519	October is crisp days and cool nights, a time to curl up around the dancing flames and sink into a good book.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.113444+00	1326	9
2520	Among my most prized possessions are words that I have never spoken.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.13483+00	1327	9
2521	Life is always walking up to us and saying, "Come on in, the living's fine," and what do we do? Back off and take its picture.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.156334+00	1328	9
2522	Good friends, good books and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.174229+00	72	9
2523	Certain flaws are necessary for the whole. It would seem strange if old friends lacked certain quirks.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.194833+00	147	9
2524	You can be more alone with other people than you are by yourself. Even with people you love.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.214851+00	1329	9
2525	Seek freedom and become captive of your desires. Seek discipline and find your liberty.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.23475+00	644	9

2527	Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared believe that something inside of them was superior to circumstance.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.27375+00	1330	9
2528	Don't be afraid of death so much as an inadequate life.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.294398+00	1331	9
2529	When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live your life in such a manner that when you die the world cries and you rejoice.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.318307+00	1332	9

2531	Even in the presence of others he was completely alone.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.36809+00	1334	9
2532	I don't like to stand out. It consumes too much of your life to be in the limelight.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.385429+00	\N	9
2533	This may not be the path for everyone. But the trust of which we speak is not an act of heroism. it is an act of surrender that makes the decision easier. It sounds unbelieveable, but I know it to be true. Leave the decision to God and you relieve yourself of the anxiety that comes from thinking that the choice is yours - the sneaking suspicion that you might have done better had you been a little more careful, a little luckier.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.409016+00	1335	9
2534	The act of putting pen to paper encourages pause for thought, this in turn makes us think more deeply about life, which helps us regain our equilibrium.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.4304+00	1336	9
2996	What most needs explanation is not why some people are criminals, but why most people are not.	2025-07-02 10:17:04.375211+00	1527	11
2536	I got a fortune cookie that said, "To remember is to understand." I have never forgotten it. A good judge remembers what it was like to be a lawyer. A good editor remembers being a writer. A good parent remembers what it was like to be a child.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.474309+00	1338	9
2537	The chorus of an old Depeche Mode song goes like this: "I don't want to start/ Any blasphemous rumours/ But I think that God's/ Got a sick sense of humour/ And when I die/ I expect to find him laughing." I have a grudging respect for this tune. In an age when God has been co-opted by mirthless sentimentalists, I appreciate any artiste who suggests there's more to the Infinite Sipirit than the pinched personality described in the holy books. On the other hand, Depeche Mode's notion of the Lord is a crock too. But one thing for sure about my Supreme Being is that She has a sublimely poetic sense of humour.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.491034+00	\N	9
2538	I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.508656+00	95	9
2539	I like libraries. It makes me feel comfortable and secure to have walls of words, beautiful and wise, all around me. I always feel better when I can see that there is something to hold back the shadows.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.529516+00	1339	9
2540	There's stories and there's stories... the ones with any worth change your life forever, perhaps in a small way, but once you've heard them, they are forever a part of you. You nurture them and pass them on and the giving only makes you feel better. The stories are just stories, they make one laugh or cry - but if they have any worth, they carry within them a deeper resonance that remains long after the final page is turned...or the storyteller has come to the end of her tale.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.552292+00	1340	9

2543	On the whole, age comes more gently to those who have some doorway into an abstract world-art, or philosophy, or learning-regions where the years are scarcely noticed and the young and old can meet in a pale truthful light.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.610147+00	1342	9
2544	What I like in a good author is not what he says, but what he whispers.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.63474+00	1343	9
2545	The need to write comes from the need to make sense of one's life and discover one's usefulness.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.654516+00	1344	9
2546	Poetry is the journal of the sea animal living on land, wanting to fly in the air. Poetry is a search for syllables to shoot at the barriers of the unknown and the unknowable. Poetry is a phantom script telling how rainbows are made and why they go away.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.672253+00	955	9
2547	Is it a fact - or have I dreamt it - that, by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve, vibrating thousands of miles in a breathless point of time? Rather, the round globe is a vast head, a brain, instinct with intelligence!	2025-07-02 10:16:54.694119+00	1345	9
2548	Each of us wages a private battle each day between the grand fantasies we have for ourselves and what actually happens.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.714167+00	1346	9
2549	Teenage boys are like clamshells. They open up just a moment in order to take in a little nourishment or expel some dirt. But then they clam up tight again. If you're around when they open up, you have a chance to see something truly beautiful inside. But you have to be there at that moment.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.776486+00	\N	9
2550	Meditation is not a way of making your mind quiet. It's a way of entering into the quiet that's already there - buried under the 50,000 thoughts the average person think every day.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.799135+00	1347	9
2551	The Autumn Willow knew what the Storm did not; that the power to endure harm outlives the power to inflict it.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.81718+00	\N	9
2552	To be a father is not simply to bring a child into this world. It is to take care of that child and to give him direction and guidance. It's my mother who always did this for me. I'm surprised that today, because of the World Cup and because the cameras are on my father, that he puts on that jersey and speaks of his son. It's not going to change things because of a World Cup.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.841051+00	1348	9
2553	One is taught by experience to put a premium on those few people who can appreciate you for what you are.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.861861+00	1349	9
2554	There is a time, when passing through a light, that you walk in your own shadow.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.881814+00	1350	9
2555	All men and women are born, to live, suffer and die; what distinguishes us one from another is our dreams, whether they be dreams about worldly or unworldly things, and what we do to make them come about... We do not choose to be born. We do not choose our parents. We do not choose our historical epoch, the country of our birth, or the immediate circumstances of our upbringing. We do not, most of us, choose to die; nor do we choose the time and conditions of our death. But within this realm of choicelessness, we do choose how we live."	2025-07-02 10:16:54.903545+00	1351	9
2556	When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world. I found it was difficult to change the world, so I tried to change my nation. When I found I couldn't change the nation, I began to focus on my town. I couldn't change the town and as an older man, I tried to change my family. Now, as an old man, I realize the only thing I can change is myself, and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself, I could have made an impact on my family. My family and I could have made an impact on our town. Their impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the world.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.919771+00	\N	9
2557	I like the stars. It's the illusion of permanence, I think. I mean, they're always flaring up and caving in and going out. But from Here I can pretend... I can pretend that things last. I can pretend that lives last longer than moments. Gods come and Gods go. Mortals Flicker and flash and fade. Worlds don't last; and stars and galaxies are transient, fleeting things that twinkle like fireflies and vanish into cold and dust. But I can pretend.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.942919+00	1352	9
2558	The difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength, not a lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.964078+00	1353	9
2559	I tried to find him on the Christian Cross, but He was not there; I went to the Temple of the Hindus and to the old pagodas, but I could not find a trace of Him anywhere.\nI searched on the mountains and in the valleys but neither in the heights nor in the depths was I able to find Him. I went to the Caaba in Mecca, but He was not there either.\nI questioned the scholars and philosophers, but He was beyond their understanding.\nI then looked into my heart and it was there where He dwelled that I saw Him; He was nowhere else to be found.	2025-07-02 10:16:54.983602+00	1354	9
2589	Look at everything as though you were seeing it for the first time or the last time. Then your time on earth will be filled with glory.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.561278+00	1369	9
2560	Will the future ever arrive?... Should we continue to look upwards? Is the light we can see in the sky one of those which will presently be extinguished? The ideal is terrifying to behold, lost as it is in the depth, small, isolated, a pin-point, brilliant but threatened on all sides by the dark forces that surrounds it; nevertheless, no more danger than a star in the jaws of the clouds.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.001605+00	85	9
2561	... there is such a thing as perfection... and our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth... Each of us is in truth an unlimited idea of freedom. Everything that limits us we have to put aside.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.019241+00	173	9
2562	Things are changing\nBut nothing changes\nAnd still there are changes	2025-07-02 10:16:55.040903+00	1355	9

2564	... At times we live our lives on a paper-thin edge that barely separates greatness from mediocrity and success from failure... Life is often compared to a marathon, but I think it is more like being a sprinter: long stretches of hard work punctuated by brief moments in which we are given the opportunity to perform our best.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.080192+00	1356	9

2567	About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you.\nMost will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.140394+00	900	9
2568	What you've done becomes the judge of what you're going to do especially in other people's minds. When you're traveling, you are what you are right there and then. People don't have your past to hold against you. No yesterdays on the road.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.161833+00	1359	9
2569	If you believe in the light, it's because of obscurity.\nIf you believe in joy, it is because of sadeness.\nIf you believe in God, then you have to believe in the Devil.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.185453+00	1360	9
2570	To rid ourselves of our shadows - who we are - we must step into either total light or total darkness.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.204201+00	557	9
2571	Laughing at ourselves is possible when we are able to see humanity as it is - a little lower than the angels and at times only slightly higher than the apes.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.225916+00	1361	9
2572	If you expect the worst from a person, you can't ever be disappointed... The pessimist takes a sort of gloomy pleasure in observing the depths to which human behaviour can sink. Everyone likes to have his deepest convictions confirmed; that is one of the most abiding of human satisfaction.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.247296+00	1362	9
2573	Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth, more than ruin, more even than death... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.26442+00	458	9
2574	We seem to be going through a period of nostalgia, and everyone seems to think yesterday was better than today. I don't think it was, and I would advise you not to wait ten years before admitting today was great. If you're hung up on nostalgia, pretend today is yesterday and just go out and have one hell of a time.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.281891+00	906	9
2575	December 18, 1995, Trans-Siberian Railway: Dante's The Divine Comedy keeps running through my mind as I gaze out at the landscape passing before me, thinking of the people who inhibit it and how they share this human condition... Are we helping or hurting each other?... How has the West come to this place of transition? Honourably? What are we bringing them? What are their expectations? Are our lives really what they imagine? We always want to believe there is a place better than our own...	2025-07-02 10:16:55.299405+00	390	9
2576	The thing I love about sports is the emotion it brings to a world where true passion is such a scarce commodity. In a society where personal, political and religious beliefs are muzzled for fear of offending, sports remains one of our last legitimate outlets. It allows us to scream and cheer and wear our bias on our sleeves and like medals of honour earned in combat. Here we can state our case, argue the obvious and steadfastly defend indefensible positions without fear or remorse.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.320661+00	1363	9
2577	One thing if for certain - we can't fight life.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.343101+00	1364	9
2578	Believe in miracles. But do not expect them.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.358342+00	\N	9
2579	Wrongfully do men lament the flight of time, accusing it of being too swift, and not perceiving that its period is sufficient. But good memory wherewith nature has endowed us causes everything long past to seem present.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.375234+00	544	9
2580	Remember the high board at the swimming pool? After days of looking up at it you finally climbed the wet steps to the platform. From there, it was higher than ever. There were only two ways down: the steps to defeat of the dive to victory. You stood on the edge, shivering in the hot sun, deathly afraid. At last you leaned too far forward, it was too late for retreat, and you dived. The high board was conquered, and you spent the rest of the day diving. Climbing a thousand high boards, we demolish fear, and turn into human beings.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.391534+00	173	9
2581	What we see depends mainly on what we look for.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.411966+00	1365	9
2582	Without passion man is a mere latent force and possibility, like the flint which awaits the shock of the iron before it can give forth its spark.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.432183+00	1366	9
2583	You gain strength, courage & confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, "I lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along." You must do the thing you think you cannot do.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.451233+00	1040	9
2584	Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.470872+00	1367	9
2585	Never make your home in a place. Make a home for yourself inside your own head. You'll find what you need to furnish it - memory, friends you can trust, love of learning, and other such things. That way it will go with you wherever you journey.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.488194+00	645	9
2586	Life is a journey. Perhaps we may be more or less pointed towards a general direction, but whether we pave that road with diamonds and gold or just plain dirt and cement is up to us.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.505364+00	1041	9
2587	At every crisis in one's life, it is absolute salvation to have some sympathetic friend to whom you can think aloud without restraint or misgiving.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.521569+00	1127	9
2588	Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.541686+00	1368	9
2591	I used to sit on the banks with a raft and watch the water roll lazily by. One day I pushed my raft into the shallows of the water and found the water moved swifter than I thought, but my raft was actually a little rowboat. Then, after some time I rowed my little boat into deeper water. There were great storms, mighty winds, tremendous waves, and sometimes I felt so alone. But I have noticed my little rowboat is now a mighty ship manned by my friends and loved ones, and beautiful calm seas, warm sunny days, and nights filled with comfortable dreams always double after a storm. Now, I could never go back and sit on the bank, in fact, I search for deeper water. Such is life when lived.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.603178+00	1371	9
2592	Sometimes it seems like there are too many roads... and you are not sure that you will ever find the right one. But that's only because we all make our own story... and exploring is how each new adventure is begun.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.620082+00	\N	9
2593	Everyone is an explorer. How could you possibly live your life looking at a door and not open it?	2025-07-02 10:16:55.641631+00	1372	9
2594	People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.659202+00	1053	9
2595	If you surrendered to the air, you could ride it.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.678458+00	1281	9
2596	If a man does not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.695998+00	95	9
2597	If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.716809+00	1373	9
2598	Most men live their lives in quiet desperation. Break forth and find new ground. Don't let it be said that you came to the end of your life and found out that you had not truly lived. Enjoy life and feast on the marrow from the bone of living.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.739095+00	1374	9
2599	It's scary sometimes when you consider that the smallest decision you make can totally change your life. A single choice and you might be hitching a ride down a totally different highway of life. And the disturbing part of all this is that you'll never know for sure what your life could be, would be, or should be. Gambles we all must take, but sometimes, the stakes are simply too high.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.756514+00	17	9
2600	Life isn't about the breaths we take, it's about the moments that take our breath away.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.772504+00	\N	9
2601	I looked upon a clock to find the truth. The hours were passing like ivory chess figures, striking piano notes, and the minutes raced on wires mounted like tin soldiers. Hours like tall ebony women with gongs between their legs, tolling continuously so that I could not count them. I heard the rolling of my heart-beats; I heard the footsteps of my dreams, and the beat of time was lost among them like the face of truth.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.789495+00	603	9
2602	In the world of the dreamer there was solitude: all the exaltations and joys came in the moment of preparation for living. They took place in solitude. But with action came anxiety, and the sense of insuperable effort made to match the dream, and with it came weariness, discouragement, and the flight into solitude again. And then in solitude, in the opium den of remembrance, the possibility of pleasure again.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.806603+00	603	9
2603	Two roads diverged in a wood, and I... I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.823725+00	70	9
2604	In uncertainty I am certain that underneath their topmost layers of frailty men want to be good and want to be loved. Indeed, most of their vices are attempted short cuts to love. When a man comes to die, no matter what his influence and genius, if he dies unloved his life must be a failure to him and his dying a cold horror. It seems to me that if you or I must choose between two courses of thought or action, we should remember our dying and try to live that our death brings no pleasure to the world.\nWe have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly re-spawn, while good, while virtue, is immortal. Vice has always a new fresh young face, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.841773+00	350	9
2605	I would rather be ashes than dust! I would rather that my spark burn out in a brilliant blaze than it be stifled by dry-rot. I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.862494+00	1375	9
2606	When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. And now when every new baby is born its first laugh becomes a fairy. So there ought to be one fairy for every boy or girl.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.883402+00	1376	9
2607	Every time a child says "I don't believe in fairies," there is a little fairy somewhere that falls down dead.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.902019+00	1376	9
2608	One of the pleasantest things in the world is going on a journey; I can enjoy society in a room; but out of doors, nature is company enough for me. I am then never less alone than when alone.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.919919+00	738	9
2609	To go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary whilst I read and write. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.938424+00	141	9
2610	Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue to exist, a wonderful living side by side can grow up, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see each other whole against the sky.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.960544+00	1377	9
2611	Some people have a large circle of friends while others have only friends that they like.	2025-07-02 10:16:55.979072+00	167	9
2612	Never fear shadows. They simply mean there's a light shining somewhere nearby.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.000563+00	1378	9
2613	Due to circumstances beyond your control, you are master of your fate and captain of your soul.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.015241+00	\N	9

2617	Absence extinguishes small passions and increases great ones, as the wind blows out a candle, and blows in a fire.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.08994+00	1056	9
2618	Whatever you want to do, do it now. There are only so many tomorrows.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.111168+00	1380	9
2619	There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.129232+00	318	9
2678	Thousands of candles can be lighted from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.305292+00	1407	9
2620	This is the fairest picture on our planet, the most enchanting to look upon, the most satisfying to the eye and spirit. To see the sun sink down, drowned in his pink and purple and golden floods, and overwhelm Florence with tides of color that make all the sharp lines dim and faint and turn the solid city to a city of dreams, is a sight to stir the coldest nature, and make a sympathetic one drunk with ecstasy.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.147663+00	72	9
2621	If we hadn't our bewitching autumn foliage, we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for all its bullying vagaries - the ice-storm: when a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the top - ice that is as bright and clear as crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen dew-drops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white, like the Shah of Persia's diamond plume. Then the wind waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires, which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red, from red to green, and green to gold-the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility in art or nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make the words too strong.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.167331+00	72	9
2622	God's finger touched him, and he slept.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.185856+00	825	9
2623	The credit belongs to the man who is in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes again and again, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best, knows the triumph of high achievement; who at worst, if he fails at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.203961+00	1006	9
2624	Tell me not, in mournful numbers, life is but an empty dream! -\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers, and things are not what they seem.\nLife is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal;\nDust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul.\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow, is our destined end or way;\nBut to act, that each to-morrow find us farther than to-day.\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting, and our hearts, though stout and brave,\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating funeral marches to the grave.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.223378+00	266	9
2625	Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I have got a hold of for the moment, and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.24182+00	119	9
2626	Days, when the ball of our vision\nHad eagles that flew unabashed to sun;\nWhen the graps on the bow was decision,\nAnd arrow and hand and eye were one;\nWhen the Pleasures, like waves to a swimmer,\nCame heaving for rapture ahead! -\nInvoke them, they dwindle, they glimmer\nAs lights over mounds of the dead.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.262892+00	1381	9
2627	Fact of the matter is, there is no hip world, there is no straight world. There's a world, you see, which has people in it who believe in a variety of different things. Everybody believes in something and everybody, by virtue of the fact that they believe in something, use that something to support their own existence.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.280011+00	279	9
2628	The true object of all human life is play. Life is a task garden, heaven is a playground.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.295404+00	\N	9
2629	Deeper meaning resides in the fairy tales told to me in my childhood than in any truth that is taught in life.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.315778+00	1382	9
2630	Take someone who suddenly speaks to you in an intimate tone that he had never used with you, who tells you what he had never dared tell anyone. Because he was ordinarily so reserved, you are rightly all the more touched. You sense there a mark of extraordinary confidence. Suddenly he has become a friend. He has chosen you for a friend; he has chosen you for a confidant. At this moment an infallible bond has been established between him and you, this bond which the philosophers call "interpersonal". Moreover it is not only between him and you that something essential has taken place; it is also within him and within you. One becomes a person by means of this genuine and intimate encounter. No one discovers himself in solitude, by turning inward on himself and by analyzing himself. It is by giving one's self that one finds himself.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.343829+00	1383	9
2631	Which is it, is man one of God's blunders or is God one of man's?	2025-07-02 10:16:56.368375+00	64	9
2632	Keep a diary, and someday it'll keep you.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.39007+00	267	9

2634	And the old man, Nagacork, the Creator, went on a long walkabout to see all the tribesmen, the birds, animals, fish, and reptiles.\nAnd as Nagacork traveled through all the different countries of the tribes he sang:\n"Allo, allo, allo, allo, allo, cha nallah, wirrit, burra burra, cubrimilla, cubrimilla. Bo bo!" This means, "Oh well, all you people who belong to me have change into men, animals, birds, reptiles, fish , sun, moon, and stars. I go now. I go forever. You will see me no more. But all the time I will watch about you.\nAnd the tribesmen say that you can see the old man Nagacork lying among the stars. His lubral (woman) is lying near him with one arm behind her head. And the tribesmen say that the stream of stars that the white man calls the Milky Way is the smoke of Nagacork's campfire drifting across the night."	2025-07-02 10:16:56.425771+00	\N	9
2635	There are only two ways of spreading light - to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.443855+00	1373	9
2636	The best things in life are nearest: Breath in your nostrils, light in your eyes, flowers at your feet, duties at your hand, the path of right just before you. Then do not grasp at the stars, but do life's plain, common work as it comes, certain that daily duties and daily bread are the sweetest things in life.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.468067+00	1385	9

2638	The moment you wake up each morning, all your wishes and hopes for the day rush at you like wild animals. And the first job each morning consists in shoving it all back; in listening to that other voice, taking that other point of view, letting that other, larger, stronger, quieter life coming flowing in.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.502119+00	140	9

2679	I stood within the city disinterred;\nAnd heard the autumnal leaves like light footfalls\nOf spirits passng through the streets;\nand heard the Mountain's slumberous voice at intervals\nThrill through those roofless halls;\nThe oracular thunder penetrating shook\nThe listening soul in my suspended blood.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.322037+00	828	9

2641	When death comes, we take off our clothes and gather everything we left behind: what is dark, broken, touched with shame. When Death demands we give an accounting, naked we present our lives in bundles. See how much these weigh, we tell him, refusing to deny what we have lived. Everything that is touched by light loves the light. We the stubborn-as-grass, we who reel at the taste of sap and want our spirits cleansed, will not betray the weeds, snake, or crippled mare. Never leave behind what the light shone on.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.566236+00	1388	9
2642	Cherish your vision; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart. The beauty that forms in your mind. The loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts. If you remain true to them, your world will at last be built.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.587623+00	1389	9

2654	Gone is the builder's temple,\nCrumbled into the dust;\nLow lies each stately pillar,\nFood for consuming rust,\nBut the temple the teacher builded\nWill last while the ages roll,\nFor that beautiful unseen temple\nWas a child's immortal soul.	2025-07-02 10:16:56.825797+00	1395	9

2666	The joy of life is made up of obscure and seemingly mundane victories that gives us our own small satisfactions.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.062275+00	1399	9

2668	Beauty is a form of genius - is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts in the world like sunlight, or springtime, or the reflection in dark water of that silver shell we call the moon.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.096163+00	55	9
2669	Were this world an endless pain, and by sailing eastward we could forever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.114124+00	653	9
2670	How is one to live a moral and compassionate existence when one is fully aware of the blood, the horror inherent in life, when one finds darkness not only in one's culture but within oneself? If there is a stage at which an individual life becomes truly adult, it must be when one grasps the irony in its unfolding and accepts responsibility for a life lived in the midst of such paradox. One must live in the middle of contradiction, because if all contradiction were eliminated at once life would collapse. There are simply no answers to some of the great pressing questions. You continue to live them out, making your life a worthy expression of leaning into the light.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.138283+00	1400	9
2671	When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives mean the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate now knowing, not curing, not healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.162215+00	1401	9

2673	We must learn not to disassociate the airy flower from the earthy root, for the flower that is cut off from its root fades, and its seeds are barren, whereas the root, secure in mother earth, can produce flower after flower and bring their fruit to maturity.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.20006+00	1402	9

2681	Life has a self-correcting mechanism - things that we once thought were terrible have a way of becoming stepping stones for new discoveries.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.361844+00	1408	9
2682	Sometimes I lie awake at night, and I asked, "Is life a multiple choice test or is it a true of false test?" Then a voice comes to me out of the dark, and says, "We hate to tell you this, but life is a thousand word essay."	2025-07-02 10:16:57.383032+00	1409	9
2683	Evils in the journey of life are like the hills which alarm travelers on their road. Both appear great at a distance, but when we approach them we find they are far less insurmountable than we had conceived.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.402362+00	1410	9

2687	We rest here while we can, but we hear the ocean calling in our dreams,\nAnd we know by the morning, the wind will fill our sails to test the seams,\nThe calm is on the water and part of us would linger by the shore,\nFor ships are safe in harbor, but that's not what ships are for.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.476718+00	1412	9
2688	It's not only children who grow. Parents do too. As much as we watch to see what our children do with their lives, they are watching us to see what we do with ours. I can't tell my children to reach for the sun. All I can do is reach for it, myself.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.498752+00	1413	9
2689	I was born to catch dragons in their dens\nAnd pick flowers\nTo tell tales and laugh away the morning\nTo drift and dream like a lazy stream\nAnd walk barefoot across sunshine days.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.519474+00	1414	9
2690	I like nonsense, it wakes up the brain cells. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, it's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. Which is what I do, and that enables you to laugh at life's realities.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.540166+00	1415	9

2693	I have an idea that some men are born out of their due place. Accident has cast them amid strangers in their birthplace, and the leafy lanes they have known from childhood or the populous streets in which they have played, remain but a place of passage. They may spend their whole lives aliens among their kindred and remain aloof among the only scenes they have ever known. Perhaps it is this sense of strangeness that sends men far and wide in the search for something more permanent, to which they may attach themselves. Perhaps some deep-rooted atavism urges the wanderer back to lands which his ancestors left in the dim beginnings of history. Sometimes a man hits upon a place to which he mysteriously feels that he belongs. here is the home he sought, and he will settle amid scenes that he has never seen before, among men he has never known, as though they were familiar to him from his birth. Here at last he finds rest.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.594519+00	562	9

2696	Advice is a form of nostalgia, dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it's worth.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.649925+00	\N	9

2698	I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life. To put to rout all that was not life. And not, when I had come to die, discover that I had not lived.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.68574+00	95	9

2700	What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves?  This is the most important of all voyages of discovery, and without it, all the rest are not only useless, but disastrous.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.718781+00	1303	9

2704	When I was a Boy Scout, we played a game when new Scouts joined the troop. We lined up chairs in a pattern, creating an obstacle course through which the new Scouts, blindfolded, were supposed to maneuver. The Scoutmaster gave them a few moments to study the pattern before our adventure began. But as soon as the victims were blindfolded, the rest of us quietly removed the chairs. I think life is like this game. Perhaps we spend our lives avoiding obstacles we have created for ourselves and in reality exist only in our minds. We're afraid to apply for that job, take violin lessons, learn a foreign language, call an old friend, write our Congressman - whatever it is that we would really like to do but don't because of personal obstacles. Don't avoid any chairs until you run smack into one. And if you do, at least you'll have a place to sit down.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.798278+00	1420	9

2706	Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could; some blunders and absurdities have crept in; forget them as soon as you can.

2710	Somehow I can't believe that there are any heights that can't be scaled by a man who knows the secrets of making dreams come true. This special secret, it seems to me, can be summarised in four Cs. Theyare curiosity, confidence, courgae and constancy, and the greatets of all is confidence. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionably.	2025-07-02 10:16:57.908243+00	274	9

2718	For the past few years, my life has been turned upside down, inside out, and I can say that I'm pretty much fed-up and had enough of my share, not with life, but with society and people.\nI've slowed down and taken a backseat and I'm watching other people's lives zoom pass while I stand motionless in time. It's pretty amazing when you view the world from a different angle. Not eveything is good in life, but not everything is bad either. I've learnt that I cannot change the world, and the world will not change for me.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.052955+00	17	9
2719	Identity would seem to be the garment with which one covers the nakedness of the self, in which case, it is best that the garment be loose, a little like the robes of the desert, through which one's nakedness can always be felt, and, sometimes, discerned. This trust in one's nakedness is all that gives one the power to change one's robes.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.073775+00	1425	9
2720	...a memorable picture sometimes overwhelms a thousand statistics.

2722	I've always thought that the most extraordinary special effect you could do is to buy a child at the moment of its birth, sit it on a little chair and say, "You'll have three score years and ten," and take a photograph every minute. "And we'll watch you and photograph you for ten years after you die, then we'll run the film." Wouldn't that be extraordinary? We'd watch this thing get bigger and bigger, and flower to become extraordinary and beautiful, then watch it crumble, decay, and rot.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.135464+00	1428	9

2725	A wonderful realization will be the day you realize that you are unique in all the world. There is nothing that is an accident. You are a special combination for a purpose-and don't let them tell you otherwise, even if they tell you that purpose is an illusion. (Live an illusion if you have to). You are that combination so that you can do what is essential for you to do. Don't ever  believe that you have nothing to contribute. The world is an incredible unfulfilled tapestry. And only you can fulfill that tiny space that is yours.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.204867+00	1429	9

2728	Every man knows when his life began... If I did not exist in the past, why should I, or could I, exist in the future? ... The purpose of man is like the purpose of the pollywog-to wiggle along as far as he can without dying, or, to hang onto life until death takes him.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.258325+00	626	9
2729	Now I beg of you to tell me whether I must love a human being simply because he exists or resembles me and whether for those reasons alone I must suddenly prefer him to myself?	2025-07-02 10:16:58.279104+00	1431	9

2731	If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.

2738	Break up the foundations of existence and build anew. There are many books on stark reality... about the disease of existence. Without denying that there are such existences but far from musing on death, I assert that a human can steer toward a higher fate, a more valuable conclusion... and, risking a trite expression, live a happier life. Perhaps this is the soft underbelly of a book exposed to the modern world: to say that one can be happier and more valuable without a "beyond" ... that one can not only learn to be content with reality, but can aggressively pursue greater and greater joy.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.442683+00	757	9
2763	Stray dogs have a patron saint. His name is boy.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.922783+00	1442	9
2739	The "Good Life" is not the destination but the road, and a very narrow and winding road at that. Always just ahead we find a sharp turn toward a need so petty that we refuse to slow down for it. And where were we going anyway? The question itself leads us astray. As we admitted before, this is merely a road. But if we resign ourselves to a road without a known destination, what striving toward will keep us on this road? ... or at least allow us to cross it as many times as possible? ... for we cross the road so rarely and haphazardly that it seems inconsequential to the journey. But now I am getting ahead of myself again. Slower, slower... not faster.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.459157+00	757	9

2742	All young monkeys are inquisitve, but the intensity of their curiosity tends to fade as they become adult. With us, the infantile inquisitiveness is strengthened and stretched out into our mature years. ...As children grow older their exploratory tendencies sometimes reach alarming proportions and adults can be heard referring to 'a group of youngsters behaving like wild animals'. But the reverse is actually the case. If the adults took the trouble to study the way in which adult wild animals really do behave, they would find that they are the wild animals. They are the ones who are trying to limit exploration and who are selling out to the cosiness of sub-human conservativism. Luckily for the species, there are always enough adults who retain their juvenile inventiveness and curiosity and who enable populations to progress and expand.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.51503+00	842	9
2743	I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of anything, and many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here, and what the question might mean. I might think about it a little bit, but if I can't figure it out, then I go on to something else. But I don't have to know an answer. I don't have to...I don't feel frightened by not knowing things, by being lost in the mysterious universe without having any purpose, which is the way it really is, as far as I can tell, possibly. It doesn't frighten me.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.536391+00	1435	9
2744	When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of space of which I am ignorant, and which knows me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there, why now rather than then.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.554188+00	507	9

2748	Time passes in moments. Moments which, rushing past us, define the path of a life even as they fix upon its end. How rarely do we stop to examine that path? To see the reasons why all things happen. To consider whether the path we have taken is of our own making, or simply one into which we've drifted with eyes closed. But what if we were to stop? To take stock of each precious moment before it passes? Might we see the endless forks in the roads that shape our lives? And... seeing the choices we've made... choose another path?	2025-07-02 10:16:58.629625+00	1436	9
2749	The most important things are the hardest to say, because words diminish them. It's hard to make strangers care about the good things in your life.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.647562+00	471	9
2750	Do the impossible, because almost everyone has told me my ideas are merely fantasies.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.66838+00	1437	9
2751	The aim of life is to live -- and to live means to be aware, joyously, wondrously, drunkenly, serenely, divinely aware.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.686427+00	187	9
2752	The one who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the crowd. The one who walks alone is likely to discover places no one has ever been before. Creativity in living is not without its attendant difficulties; For peculiarity breed contempt. And the unfortunate thing about being ahead of your time is that when people finally realize you were right, they'll say it was obvious all along.You have two choices in life: you can dissolve into the mainstream or you can be distinct. To be distinct, you must be different. To be different, you must strive to be what no one else but you can be .	2025-07-02 10:16:58.702574+00	\N	9
2753	I thought, when I came upon her, that I was seizing hold of life... Instead I lost hold of life completely. I reached out for something to attach myself to - and I found nothing. But in reaching out, in the effort to grasp, to attach myself, left high and dry as I was, I nevertheless found something I had not looked for - myself.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.719149+00	187	9
2754	If you could see your ancestors\nAll standing in a row,\nWould you be proud of them or not,\nOr don't you really know?\nBut here's another question, which\nRequires a different view --\nIf you could meet your ancestors\nWould they be proud of you?	2025-07-02 10:16:58.734755+00	\N	9
2755	What a poor, impoverished world it would be that had no weeds to defy man's narrow idea of order or to suggest new possibilities to our too-lmited minds. Who can calculate the strength we receive when we see and identify with a dandelion growing from a crack in the sidewalk to bloom brightly amid adversity?\nIt makes me feel that I should be capable of just a bit more, when I see what weeds accomplish on what they receive.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.754914+00	1438	9
2756	In three word I can sum up everything I've learned about life. It goes on.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.772255+00	70	9
2757	Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity, they think of you.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.793446+00	1439	9
2758	What do I want to take home from my summer holiday? Time. The wonderful luxury of being at rest. The days when you shut down the mental machinery that keeps life on track and let life simply wander. The days when you stop planning, analysing, thinking and just are. Summer is my period of grace.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.815912+00	1440	9
2759	Chance is always powerful. Let your hook be always cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be a fish.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.834223+00	120	9
2760	It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.85187+00	664	9
2761	The world is a frail pinwheel of simplistic dreams, aspirations that will never pan out. That doesn't matter, dreams and aspirations are what we get up in the morning for. The simple wish that maybe this day will be better than the last is what gets us through each day.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.874333+00	1441	9
2764	Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.943985+00	141	9
2766	There is a big misunderstanding about the idea of naturalness. Most people who come to us believing in some freedom or naturalness, but their understanding is what we call [heretical naturalness] ... a kind of "let-alone policy" or sloppiness... For a plant or stone to be natural is no problem. But for us there is some problem, indeed a big problem. To be natural is something we must work on.	2025-07-02 10:16:58.997415+00	1444	9
2767	Hatred seems to operate the same glands as love: it even produces the same actions.  If we had not been taught how to interpret the story of the Passion, would we have been able to say from their actions alone whether it was the jealous Judas or the cowardly Peter who loved Christ?	2025-07-02 10:16:59.027994+00	1445	9
2768	Laura and Johnny walk down the halls together. Alone, everyday, as close as two people can be. Sharing laughs, good times, the've become the best of friends - so far, inseperable. The school wouldn't be the same without them if they ever were apart. The special gleam in Laura's eyes said so, but in two months, a lot will happen. In two months, Laura plans to graduate and in two months, Johnny will be born.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.054385+00	1446	9
2769	We cling to those truths that keep us sane.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.072901+00	\N	9

2772	If we hadn't our bewitching autumn foliage, we should still have to credit the weather with one feature which compensates for all its bullying vagaries -- the ice-storm: when a leafless tree is clothed with ice from the bottom to the top -- ice that is as bright and clear as crystal; when every bough and twig is strung with ice-beads, frozen dew-drops, and the whole tree sparkles cold and white like the Shah of Persia's diamond plume. Then the wind waves the branches and the sun comes out and turns all those myriads of beads and drops to prisms that glow and burn and flash with all manner of colored fires; which change and change again with inconceivable rapidity from blue to red, from red to green, and green to gold -- the tree becomes a spraying fountain, a very explosion of dazzling jewels; and it stands there the acme, the climax, the supremest possibility in art or nature, of bewildering, intoxicating, intolerable magnificence. One cannot make the words too strong!	2025-07-02 10:16:59.138826+00	72	9
2773	I see rock music as the best example of modernday storytelling that exists in our society. Songs are narratives that help the listeners cope with the reality of life that can't be easily spoken about in everyday conversation. It is a hugely powerful process of helping people find themselves through music.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.169432+00	1447	9
2774	We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.192017+00	986	9
2775	As if you could kill time without injuring eternity!	2025-07-02 10:16:59.21746+00	95	9
2776	I had seen birth and death,\nBut had thought they were different.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.242412+00	1448	9
2777	I believe that today more than ever a book should be sought after even if it has only one great page in it: we must search for fragments, splinters, toenails, anything that has ore in it, anything that is capable of resuscitating the body and soul. It may be that we are doomed, that there is no hope for us, any of us, but if that is so then let us set up a last agonizing, bloodcurdling howl, a screech of defiance, a war whoop! Away with lamentation! Away with elegies and dirges! Away with biographies and histories, and libraries and museums! Let the dead eat the dead. Let us living ones dance about the rim of the crater, a last expiring dance. But a dance!	2025-07-02 10:16:59.262345+00	187	9
2778	Perhaps I have not lined his portrait too clearly. But if he exists, if only for the reason that I have imagined him to be. He came from the blue and returns to the blue. He has not perished, he is not lost. Neither will he be forgotten.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.28203+00	187	9
2779	We are all guilty of crime the great crime of not living life to the full.\nBut we are all potentially free.\nWe can stop thinking of what we have failed to do and do whatever lies within our power.\nWhat those powers that are in us may be no one has truly dared to imagine.\nThat they are infinite we will realize the day we admit to ourselves that imagination is everything.\nImagination is the voice of daring.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.301243+00	187	9
2780	Lend and borrow to the maximum-of both books and money. But especially books, for books represent infinitely more than money. A book is not only a friend, it makes friends for you. When you have possessed a book with mind and spirit, you are enriched. But when you pass it on you are enriched threefold.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.318911+00	187	9
2781	I understand now.\nI want to be written about. This is different from, or, in fact, irrelevant to wanting a story of one's own life. When I say 'story', I had meant 'to be written' and seen apart.\nLife would always be life if you lived it through the way you want to. It's only fascinating when you cannot choose your elements, chronology, climaxes and ending. I want to fascinate people so that I fascinate myself. Or perhaps, the only way I feel life lived, is when I feel fascinated with my story. How could I if I could predict the next act?\nA protagonist would never be able to read his own story the way 'its' readers read him or her. I am the actor and the writer, that makes a biography or a memoir, doesn't it? Hello, we are looking for a story here, right? S.T.O.R.Y.\nIt's always more fascinating inviting God to fade into you.\nA paradox that consumes you while you live, but lives only because you do.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.336252+00	775	9
2782	I have often wondered how anyone who does not read, by which I mean daily, having some book going all the time, can make it through life. Indeed if I were required to make a sharp division in the very nature of people, I would be tempted to make it there: readers and nonreaders of books It is astonishing how the presence or absence of this habit so consistently characterizes an individual in other respects; it is as though it were a kind of barometer of temperament, of personality, even of character. Aside from that, for me it constituted something like sanity insurance.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.356716+00	1449	9
2783	And the end of all our searching shall be to return to the place where we started and know it for the first time.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.379388+00	1450	9
2784	There are words I have never really understoood, such as "sin". Yet I believe these men have never sinned against lfe. For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implaceble grandeur of this life.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.398909+00	569	9
2808	A lady came up to me on the street and pointed at my suede jacket. 'You know a cow was murdered for that jacket?' she sneered. I replied in a psychotic tone, 'I didn't know there were any witnesses. Now I'll have to kill you too.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.169881+00	1464	10
2814	Why do people give each other flowers? To celebrate various important occasions, they're killing living creatures? Why restrict it to plants? "Sweetheart, let's make up. Have this deceased squirrel."	2025-07-02 10:17:00.269688+00	\N	10
2785	Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even get the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in the Flock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth... we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome...	2025-07-02 10:16:59.417371+00	173	9
2786	There is no such thing as an average person, but on the same token there are distinctive similarities between people: air breathing, food eating, ten fingered people. I guess I am one of them, somewhat average, however I am not the one to be discounted. Nor am I the one to be celebrated for that matter. Who knows what they are worth or are capable of, I suppose it's a good thing that we don't.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.445995+00	1451	9
2787	One of the sources of pride in being a human being is the ability to bear present frustrations in the interests of longer purposes.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.472396+00	1452	9
2788	There are people, who, when meet their happy rival, are ready to turn their back to all the good that is in him, and to see only bad things; but still there are people who, in contrary, most of all are willing to find all that good qualities by which he concured them, and with a pain in a heart they are searching only for the good.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.492066+00	273	9
2789	Eternity takes back its own, Our bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not... yet, I occurred.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.509969+00	648	9
2790	[But] you don't do it. Because guys like us, Red, we know there's a third choice. An alternative to staying simon-pure or bathing in the filth and the slime. It's the alternative that grown-ups all over the world pick. You balance off your walk through the hog-wallow against what it gains you. You choose the lesser of two evils and try to keep your good intentions in front of you. And I guess you judge how well you're doing by how well you sleep at night... and what your dreams are like.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.527325+00	471	9
2791	I have the world's largest collection of seashells. I keep them on all the beaches of the world. Perhaps you've seen it.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.550625+00	1453	9

2793	Books are the carriers of civilization. Without books, history is silent, literature dumb, science cripped. Thought and speculation at a standstill. They are engines of change, windows on the world, lighthouses erected in a sea of time.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.592222+00	1455	9
2794	Four things are destroyed by the other fours: kindness by ingratitude, strength (of government) by crime, power by power and human love by arrogance.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.613806+00	1456	9

2799	I wonder how many people I've looked at all my life and never seen. It's scary to think about. Point of reference again. When two people meet, each one is changed by the other so you've got two new people.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.709413+00	350	9
2800	Most of us see life through a cloudy lens, trying to see the positive and avoid the negative, never knowing that it is the two forces together that make life worth living. Life without the positive is merely pain and life without the negative is forever dillusion.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.72658+00	521	9
2801	Don't you hate it when people use military time? Don't make me do math! "I want that report by 800 hours." "Uhhhh. 800 hours..that's 33 days. I've got plenty of time!"	2025-07-02 10:17:00.029823+00	1459	10
2802	Did you hear about the big lawsuit against Disneyland? Some kids saw the Disney characters without their heads on. And they were traumatized. And now they need a couple million dollars. Give me a break. When I was a kid I saw my Uncle Billy with his pants off! All I got was a dollar to keep my mouth shut.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.046494+00	1459	10
2803	Sometimes when it's raining really really hard outside and I'm inside, I want to find the guy who invented buildings and give him a big kiss.  Not a big wet kiss, though, because that would defeat the purpose.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.06171+00	\N	10

2805	The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war. Pretty impressive. Also pretty lucky for them. Ever see that little Swiss Army knife they have to fight with? Not much of a weapon there. Corkscrews. Bottle openers. 'Come on, buddy, let's go. You get past me, the guy in back of me, he's got a spoon. Back off. I've got the toe clippers right here.'	2025-07-02 10:17:00.101443+00	1461	10
2806	Relationships are hard. It's like a full-time job, and we should treat it like one. If your boyfriend or girlfriend wants to leave you, they should give you two weeks' notice. There should be severance pay, and before they leave you, they should have to find you a temp.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.122209+00	1462	10

2819	Did you see these new minivan ads? All they talk about are cup holders, kiddie seats and doors. What kind of advertising is that?

2822	Boy, when you are dead, they really fix you up. I hope to hell when I do die somebody has sense enough to just dump me in the river or something. Anything except sticking me in a goddam cemetery. People coming and putting a bunch of flowers on your stomach on Sunday and all that crap. Who wants flowers when you are dead? Nobody.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.408038+00	1467	10
2823	During the mid-1980s dairy farmers decided there was too much cheap milk at the supermarket. So the government bought and slaughtered 1.6 million dairy cows. How come the government never does anything like this with lawyers?	2025-07-02 10:17:00.428784+00	1468	10

2829	My young brother asked me what happens after we die. I told him we get buried under a bunch of dirt and worms eat our bodies. I guess I should have told him the truth - that most of us go to Hell and burn eternally - but I didn't want to upset him.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.53126+00	\N	10
2830	Um, not sure. I just had the most hilarious recollection of this episode on the Discovery Channel I saw with rabbits having sex. Truly a representation of the human experience, the male was humping away, about 300 strokes a minute, while the female had this look on her face that I can only equate with 'I wonder what shade I should get my nails done with tomorrow'. True to form, the male kept on going at it, even up until the point where he fell over to the side, losing penetration, yet still pumping away like mad.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.552994+00	1469	10
2831	When a cat is dropped, it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands with the buttered side facing down. I propose to strap buttered toast to the back of a cat; the two will hover, spinning, inches above the ground. With a giant buttered-cat array, a high-speed monorail could easily link New York with Chicago.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.572837+00	1470	10
2832	Most dogs are earnest, which is why people like them. You can say any fool thing to a dog, and he will give you this look that says, "Wow! You're RIGHT! I NEVER would have thought of that!"	2025-07-02 10:17:00.590352+00	34	10
2833	Ever consider what pets must think of us? I mean, here we come back from a grocery store with the most amazing haul - chicken, pork, half a cow... They must think we're the greatest hunters on earth!	2025-07-02 10:17:00.60917+00	1471	10
2834	This is easy. You never have to figure out what to get for children, because they'll tell you exactly what they want. They spend months and months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday-morning cartoon-show advertisements. Make sure you get your children exactly what they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices. If your child thinks he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You Can Rip Right Off, you'd better get it. You may be worried that it might help to encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe me, you have not seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child who is convinced that he or she did not get the right gift.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.628171+00	34	10
2835	If life on Earth were to evaporate, and the planet be visited by alien anthropologists, they will wonder at the regularity with which they find brown bottles and aluminum cans in the hollow spaces of concrete walls, and they will conclude that these artifacts represent some sort of offering to some kind of deity with the short name "Beer" and they will discover that the delphic oracle for this God was no doubt a place called "Milwaukee" since it will be there that they will find where most of the icons to this God were created.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.644922+00	\N	10
2836	If you want to give a man something practical, consider tires. More than once, I would have gladly traded all the gifts I got for a new set of tires.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.661841+00	34	10
2837	I believe in making the world safe for our children, but not our children's children, because I don't think children should be having sex.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.679732+00	33	10
2838	Maybe in order to understand mankind we have to look at that word itself. MANKIND. Basically, it's made up of two separate words "mank" and "ind." What do these words mean? It's a mystery and that's why so is mankind.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.697122+00	33	10
2839	To me, clowns aren't funny. In fact, they're kinda scary. I've wondered where this started and I think it goes back to the time I went to the circus and a clown killed my dad.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.715328+00	33	10
2992	In life we make the best mistakes we know how to make. Then, with luck, we go out and make new ones.	2025-07-02 10:17:04.293555+00	1523	11
2840	When I found the skull in the woods, the first thing I did was call the police. But then I got curious about it. I picked it up, and started wondering who this person was, and why he had deer horns.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.732575+00	33	10
2841	Sometimes I think you have to march right in and demand your rights, even if you don't know what your rights are, or who the person is you're talking to. Then on the way out, slam the door.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.749259+00	\N	10
2842	I'd like to see a nature film where an eagle swoops down and pulls a fish out of a lake, and then maybe he's flying along, low to the ground, and the fish pulls a worm out of the ground. Now that's a documentary.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.764976+00	\N	10
2843	Somebody told me how frightening it was how much topsoil we are losing each year, but I told that story around the campfire and nobody got scared.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.782232+00	33	10
2844	You have to stay in shape. My grandmother, she started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She's 97 today and we don't know where she is.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.801712+00	1472	10
2845	I went into a McDonald's yesterday and said, "I'd like some fries."\nThe girl at the counter said, "Would you like some fries with that?"	2025-07-02 10:17:00.822712+00	1473	10
2846	I'd like to see a nude opera, because when they hit those high notes, I bet you can really see it in those genitals.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.838946+00	\N	10
2847	If you're in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at the enemy, throw one of those small pumpkins. Maybe it'll make everyone think how stupid war is, and while they are thinking, you can throw a real grenade at them.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.85383+00	\N	10
2848	I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.867895+00	\N	10
2849	Why do people in ship mutinies always ask for "better treatment"? I'd ask for a pinball machine, because with all that rocking back and forth you'd probably be able to get a lot of free games.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.883271+00	\N	10
2850	Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.899835+00	33	10
2851	The very existence of flame-throwers proves that some time, somewhere, someone said to themselves, 'You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but I'm just not close enough to get the job done.'	2025-07-02 10:17:00.917658+00	457	10
2852	In Germany, Gunther Burpus remained wedged in his front-door cat flap for two days because passers-by thought he was a piece of installation art. Mr Burpus, 41, of Bremen, was using the flap because he had mislaid his keys. Unfortunately he was spotted by a group of student pranksters who removed his trousers and pants, painted his bottom bright blue, stuck a daffodil between his buttocks and erected a sign saying 'Germany Resurgent, an Essay in Street Art. Please give Generously'. Passers-by assumed Mr Burpus' screams were part of the act and it was only when an old woman complained to the police that he was finally freed. "I kept calling for help," he said, "but people just said 'Very good! Very clever!' and threw coins at me."	2025-07-02 10:17:00.932682+00	\N	10
2853	I believe you should live each day as if it is your last, which is why I don't have any clean laundry because, come on, who wants to wash clothes on the last day of their life?	2025-07-02 10:17:00.949091+00	33	10
2854	You can't be a Real Country unless you have a BEER and an airline. It helps if you have some kind of a football team, or some nuclear weapons, but at the very least you need a BEER.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.966494+00	279	10
2855	Sometimes, when I drive across the desert in the middle of the night, with no other cars around, I start imagining: What if there were no civilization out there? No cities, no factories, no people? And then I think: No people or factories? Then who made this car? And this highway? And I get so confused I have to stick my head out the window into the driving rain - unless there's lightning, because I could get struck on the head by a bolt.	2025-07-02 10:17:00.98495+00	33	10
2856	I voted for the Democrats because I didn't like the way the Republicans were running the country. Which is turning out to be like shooting yourself in the head to stop your headache.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.004285+00	1474	10
2857	Probably the earliest flyswatters were nothing more than some sort of striking surface attached to the end of a long stick.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.022222+00	33	10
2858	It takes a big man to cry, but it takes an even bigger man to laugh at that man.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.039873+00	33	10
2859	I bet the main reason the police keep people away from a plane crash is they don't want anybody walking in and lying down in the crash stuff, then, when somebody  comes up, act like they just woke up and go, "What was THAT?!"	2025-07-02 10:17:01.056788+00	33	10
2860	If trees could scream, would we be so cavalier about cutting them down? We might, if they screamed all the time, for no good reason.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.073076+00	33	10
2861	If you ever fall off the Sears Tower, just go real limp, because maybe you'll look like a dummy and people will try to catch you because, hey, free dummy.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.090337+00	33	10
2862	Anytime I see something screech across a room and latch onto someone's neck, and the guy screams and tries to get it off, I have to laugh, because what is that thing?	2025-07-02 10:17:01.109947+00	33	10
2863	Whenever I see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, my first instinct is to laugh. But then I think, what if I was an ant, and she fell on me. Then it wouldn't seem quite so funny.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.130245+00	33	10
2864	The other day I got out my can opener and was opening a can of worms when I thought, "What am I doing?"	2025-07-02 10:17:01.14965+00	33	10
2865	Don't ever get your speedometer confused with your clock, like I did once, because the faster you go the later you think you are.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.168644+00	33	10
2866	You know how to paint a room real fast? Just put paint rollers on your feet and then somehow figure out how to skate up the walls and across the ceiling.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.187321+00	33	10
2867	Isn't it horrible that a family can be torn apart by something as simple as a pack of wolves?	2025-07-02 10:17:01.205478+00	33	10
2868	Kids don't say, "Wait." They say, "Wait up, hey wait up!" Because when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. "Hold up. Shut up! Mum, I'll clean up. Let me stay up!"\nParents, of course, are just the opposite. Everything is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here! Sit down. Put... that... down."	2025-07-02 10:17:01.223214+00	1461	10
2869	Where navigation is concerned, things have changed radically since the days of Colombus. Columbus departed for India and arrived in Santo Domingo. Today, if you catch a plane to India, you arrive in India. It's your luggage that goes to Santo Domingo.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.244691+00	1475	10

2871	Did you ever notice, when you are sitting at a red light, that when the person in front of you pulls up a couple of inches, you are compelled to move up too? Do we really think we are making progress toward our destination? "Whew, I thought we would be late, but now that I am nine inches closer, I can stop for coffee and a Danish!"	2025-07-02 10:17:01.27543+00	\N	10
2872	The most unfair thing about life is the way it ends. I mean, life is tough. It takes up a lot of your time. What do you get at the end of it? A death. What's that, a bonus? I think the life cycle is all backwards. You should die first, get it out of the way. Then you live in an old age home. You get kicked out when you're too young, you get a gold watch, you go to work. You work forty years until you're young enough to enjoy retirement. You drink alcohol, you party, and you get ready for High School. You go to grade school, you become a kid, you play, you have no responsibilities, you become a little baby, you go back into the womb, you spend your last 9 months floating... then you finish off as an orgasm! Amen.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.296217+00	1476	10
2873	One day my friend called and said, "I FOUND JESUS!" and my response was "Great we are going to be rich." But it turned out to be something completely different.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.313877+00	33	10
2874	Why do people say ' Not for all the tea in China'? Are there actually people out there that would accept a deal if this were included?	2025-07-02 10:17:01.331109+00	\N	10
2875	Love can sweep you off your feet and carry you along in a way that you've never known before. But the ride always ends, and you end up feeling lonely and bitter. Wait it's not love I'm thinking of, I'm thinking of a monorail.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.348922+00	33	10
2876	One day I saw a big kid beating up a little kid. I went over to the little kid and gave him a swift kick. He probably deserved it.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.366536+00	33	10
2877	People say the hardest thing to do is lose. To me, beating up the guys who beat you is ten times harder cause some of those guys are pretty big.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.386386+00	521	10
2878	Once I saw my parents argue because we didn't have a lot of money anymore. So, I did what I had to do. I got my piggy bank and I went out to the backyard and buried it	2025-07-02 10:17:01.403587+00	33	10
2879	Why is that sign in the public bathrooms that says "Employees must wash their hands before returning to work" also written in Braille? How does the blind person find the sign? And how do they know it says the same thing in English?	2025-07-02 10:17:01.4187+00	\N	10
2880	When I was a kid, my mother would say, "You're driving me straight to the mental house." I often wondered why we never went. Probably because I was too young to drive.	2025-07-02 10:17:01.438992+00	1477	10
2881	I have no money and three kids. Why can't I have no kids and three money?	2025-07-02 10:17:02.200238+00	1478	11

2885	I got into a fight one time with a really big guy, and he said, "I'm going to mop the floor with your face." I said, "You'll be sorry." He said, "Oh yeah? Why?" I said, "Well, you won't be able to get into the corners very well."	2025-07-02 10:17:02.279136+00	1482	11
2886	When you [Americans] landed on the moon, that was the point when God should have come up and said hello. Because if you invent some creatures and you put them on the blue one and they make it to the grey one, then you fucking turn up and say, "Well done." Its just a polite thing to do.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.299536+00	1483	11
2887	If you trust in yourself...and believe in your dreams... and follow your star - you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.315779+00	823	11
2888	Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.332516+00	823	11
2889	The reason people use a crucifix against vampires is that vampires are allergic to bullshit.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.352848+00	1484	11

2891	If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.\nA person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.387796+00	1485	11

2895	I feel sorry for Obama because he's still got to fight the innate racism of Americans. I mean, did you see his first speech, when he got made President and they put all that bullet proof glass in front of him? I think that shows you how racist America still is. Just because he's black doesn't mean he's going to shoot anybody.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.457897+00	1487	11

2898	I believe Sarah Palin is a true statesman, whose experience as a failed vice presidential candidate, half-term governor and eight-episode reality star has fully prepared her to take control of our nuclear arsenal.	2025-07-02 10:17:02.509458+00	1489	11

3137	The big problem with pornography is defining it You can't just say it's pictures of people naked. For example, you have these primitive African tribes that exist by chasing the wildebeest on foot, and they have to go around largely naked, because, as the old tribal saying goes: "N'wam k'honi soit qui mali," which means, "If you think you can catch a wildebeest in this climate and wear clothes at the same time, then I have some beach front property in the desert region of Northern Mali that you may be interested in."\nSo it's not considered pornographic when National Geographic publishes color photographs of these people hunting the wildebeest naked, or pounding one rock onto another rock for some primitive reason naked, or whatever. But if National Geographic were to publish an article entitled "The Girls of the California Junior College System Hunt the Wildebeest Naked," some people would call it pornography. But others would not. And still others, such as the Spectacularly Rev. Jerry Falwell, would get upset about seeing the wildebeest naked.	2025-07-02 10:17:06.744946+00	34	11

You can't start someone off in a muddy shack in the middle of a war zone and expect them to do as well as someone born in a castle.\nAh, Arizaphale had said, that's the good bit.

4337	When students cheat on exams, it's because our school system values grades more than students value learning.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.731415+00	455	13
4338	It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great openness to new ideas  If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you  On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot distinguish the useful ideas from the worthless ones.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.748037+00	302	13
4339	The time to buy stocks is consistently over time. You should never buy your investments with the idea, 'I have to get a certain return.'  You should look at the best return possible and learn to live with that.  But you should not try to make your investments earn what you feel you need.  It doesn't work that way. The stock doesn't know you own it.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.763966+00	467	13
4340	The phrase I use all the time is, "the kids are alright," from the Who. It's amazing to me, you know, I'm 54 years old, and it's amazing to me watching my peers turn into these cartoons. They say, shit like, "well you know, when we were kids we weren't this rude, and we wouldnt say this stuff. I would have never done this." And it's absolute fucking bullshit, and we certainly have records going back thousands of years that adults always hate the younger generation. Adults always find a reason to hate people that are 20-years-old, and I don't know why it is. Clearly and provably every generation gets better. Every generation gets healthier, smarter, more sophisticated, and that's always been true. Twenty-year-olds are just better than us. Old people just can't seem to get it through their heads that things are getting better and that's wonderful. Not only do young people not have polio, not only are young people less racist, less homophobic, and less violent  not only is all that true, but they also have some really really cool art, and some of that art we don't understand. The problem is a question of time.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.784434+00	462	13
4341	You know, when I was 15, 16, 17-years-old, I spent five hours a day juggling, and I probably spent six hours a day seriously listening to music. And if I were 16 now, I would put that time into playing video games. The thing that old people don't understand is  you know if you've never heard Bob Dylan, and someone listened to him for 15 minutes, you're not going to get it. You are just not going to understand. You have to put in hours and hours to start to understand the form, and the same thing is true for gaming. You're not going to just look at a first-person shooter where you are killing zombies and understand the nuances. There is this tremendous amount of arrogance and hubris, where somebody can look at something for five minutes and dismiss it. Whether you talk about gaming or 20th century classical music, you can't do it in five minutes. You can't listen to The Rite of Spring once and understand what Stravinsky was all about. It seems like you should at least have the grace to say you don't know, instead of saying that what other people are doing is wrong. The clich├® of the nerdy kid who doesn't go outside and just plays games is completely untrue. And it's also true for the nerdy kid who studies comic books and turns into this genius, and it is also true for the nerdy kid who listens to every nerdy thing that Led Zeppelin put out. That kind of obsession in a 16-year-old is not ugly. It's beautiful. That kind of obsession is going to lead to a sophisticated 30-year-old who has a background in that artform. It just seems so simple, and yet I'm constantly in these big arguments with people on the computer who are talking about, "I would never let my kid do this and this in a video game." And these are adults who when they were children were dropping acid and going to see the Grateful Dead. I mean, the Grateful Dead is provably shitty music. It's impossible  it's theoretically impossible to make a video game as bad as the Grateful Dead. I throw that out there as a challenge.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.805947+00	462	13

4343	I have concluded through careful empirical analysis and much thought that somebody is looking out for me, keeping track of what I think about things, forgiving me when I do less than I ought, giving me strength to shoot for more than I think I'm capable of. I believe they know everything that I do and think, and they still love me, and I've concluded, after careful consideration, that this person keeping score is me.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.853212+00	1935	13

4347	Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal rather than religion-specific values... it requires that their proposals be subject to argument and amenable to reason.\nNow, I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, to take one example, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.	2025-07-02 10:17:29.933127+00	1938	13

4361	Youve got to be able to hold a lot of contradictory ideas in your mind without going nuts. I feel like to do my job right, when I walk out on stage Ive got to feel like its the most important thing in the world. Also Ive got to feel like, well, its only rock and roll.

4362	Death is very likely the single best invention of life. Its lifes change agent; it clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but its quite true. Your time is limited, so dont waste it living someone elses life. Dont be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other peoples thinking. Dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice, heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary... Stay hungry, stay foolish.	2025-07-02 10:17:30.217225+00	1944	13
4363	You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end... Youre not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. Youre going to advance in life by what youre going to learn after you leave here.	2025-07-02 10:17:30.237663+00	1945	13

4365	If someone does offer you a job, say 'yes.' You can always quit later. Then at least you'll be one of the unemployed as opposed to one of the never-employed. Nothing looks worse on a resume than nothing.	2025-07-02 10:17:30.270759+00	1489	13
4366	I saw something in the paper last week about Kermit the Frog giving a commencement address somewhere. One of the students was complaining, 'I worked my ass off for four years to be addressed by a sock?' You have worked your ass off for this. For four years you've been buying, trading, and selling, everything you've got in this marketplace of ideas. The intellectual hustle. Your pockets are full, even if your parents' are empty, and now you've got to figure out what to spend it on... So, my question I suppose is: What's the big idea? What's your big idea? What are you willing to spend your moral capital, your intellectual capital, your cash, your sweat equity in pursuing outside of the walls of the University of Pennsylvania? My point is that the world is more malleable than you think and it's waiting for you to hammer it into shape.	2025-07-02 10:17:30.286118+00	213	13
4367	As you start your journey, the first thing you should do is throw away that store-bought map and begin to draw your own Dont spend so much time trying to choose the perfect opportunity, that you miss the right opportunity. Recognize that there will be failures, and acknowledge that there will be obstacles.

4376	When we look at modern man we have to face the fact that modern man suffers from a kind of poverty of the spirit, which stands in glaring contrast to his scientific and technological abundance, we've learned to fly the air like birds, we've learned to swim the seas like fish, and yet we havent learned to walk the earth as brothers and sisters.	2025-07-02 10:17:30.459082+00	1948	13

4425	It is wrong to expect a reward for your struggles. The reward is the act of struggle itself, not what you win. Even though you can't expect to defeat the absurdity of the world, you must make that attempt. That's morality, that's religion. That's art. That's life.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.402369+00	1972	13

4428	... don't let your elders and supposed betters tell you any different. Sure, you've never been to Paris. No, you never ran with the bulls at Pamploma. Yes, you're a pissant who had no hair in your armpits until three years ago - but so what? If you don't start out too big for your britches, how are you gonna fill 'em when you grow up? Let it rip regardless of what anybody tells you, that's my idea; sit down an\nsmoke\nthat baby.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.459006+00	471	13

4432	Money may be the husk of many things, but not the kernal.  It brings you food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; acquaintances, but not friends; servants but not loyalty; days of joy, but not peace or happiness.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.531322+00	570	13

4442	I might say: if the place I want to get to could only be reached by way of a ladder, I would give up trying to get there. For the place I really have to get to is a place I must already be at now. Anything that I might reach by climbing a ladder does not interest me.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.699104+00	667	13

4447	So far as I am concerned, poetry and every other art was and is and forever will be strictly and distinctly a question of individuality... If poetry is your goal, you've got to forget all about punishments and all about rewards and all about self-styled obligations and duties and responsibilities etcetera ad infinitum and remember one thing only: that it's you - nobody else - who determine your destiny and decide your fate. Nobody else can be alive for you; nor can you be alive for anybody else... There's the artist's responsibility; and the most awful responsibility on earth.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.791387+00	1981	13

4452	In a state-run society the government promises you security. But it's a false promise predicated on the idea that the opposite of security is risk. Nothing could be further from the truth. The opposite of security is insecurity, and the only way to overcome insecurity is to take risks. The gentle government that promises to hold your hand as you cross the street refuses to let go on the other side.	2025-07-02 10:17:31.880747+00	1984	13

4454	It is often argued that the people who will be affected by a major decision should be involved in it. Paul Kruger, president of the Transvaal in southern Africa, once resolved a dispute between two brothers about a land inheritance they were to share.

4459	The point is, ladies and gentlemen, greed is good. Greed works, greed is right. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all its forms, greed for life, money, love, knowledge, has marked the upward surge of mankind -- and greed, mark my words -- will save not only Teldar Paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.008736+00	1988	13

4466	Once we admit that there is room for newness  that there are vastly more conceivable possibilities than realized outcomes  we must confront the fact that there is no special logic behind the world we inhabit, no particular justification for why things are the way they are. Any number of arbitrarily small perturbations along the way could have made the world as we know it turn out very differently.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.14757+00	1994	13

4477	A small trouble is like a pebble. Hold it too close to your eye and it fills the whole world and puts everything out of focus. Hold it at a proper distance and it can be examined and properly classified. Throw it at your feet and it can be seen in its true setting, just one more tiny bump on the pathway to life.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.342655+00	1998	13
4478	Whatever someone told you, you can never be sure of what they said. Whatever someone said, you can never be sure of what you were meant to understand - so if it's really this complicated, what's the point of trying to infer things when you can just ask.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.361296+00	1999	13
4479	Every man has three characters: that which he shows, that which he has, and that which he thinks he has.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.380096+00	2000	13

4484	Lots of people have asked me what Gracie and I did to make our marriage work. It's simple - we don't do anything. I think the trouble with a lot of people is that they work too hard at staying married. They make a business out of it. When you work too hard at a business you get tired; and when you get tired you get grouchy; and when you get grouchy you start fighting; and when you start fighting you're out of business.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.468325+00	221	13
4485	To wisely live your life, you don't need to know much\nJust rememeber two main rules for the beginning:\nYou better starve, than eat whatever\nAnd better be alone, than with whoever.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.490082+00	2002	13

4490	And what is the most potent myth of all? She went on, in the slightly ringing tones that caused him to make a discreet sign to the waiter for the bill. The tortoise and the hare, she pronounced. People love this one, especially women. Now you will notice, Harold, that in my books it is the mouse-like un-assuming girl who gets the hero, while the scornful temptress with whom he has had a stormy affair retreats baffled from the fray, never to return. The tortoise wins every time. This is a lie, of course, she said, pleasantly, but with authority, the kiwi fruit slipping back unnoticed onto her plate. In real life of course, it is the hare who wins. Every time. Look around you. And in any case it is my contention that Aesop was writing for the tortoise market. Axiomatically, she cried, her voice rising with enthusiasm. Hares have no time to read. They are too busy winning the game. The propaganda goes all the other way, but only because it is the tortoise who is in need of consolation.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.585155+00	2006	13
4491	In a moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing to do. The worst thing you can do is nothing.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.60361+00	1006	13

4494	It's not what you gather, but what you scatter that tells what kind of life you have lived.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.664894+00	2009	13
4495	I have learned that success is to measured not so much by the position one has reached in life, but by the obstacles he has overcome while trying to succeed.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.683749+00	2010	13

4497	You make your own dream. That's the Beatles' story, isn't it? That's Yoko's story. That's what I'm saying now. Produce your own dream. If you want to save Peru, go save Peru. It's quite possible to do anything, but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters. Don't expect Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan or John Lennon or Yoko Ono or Bob Dylan or Jesus Christ to come and do it for you. You have to do it yourself. That's what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began. They can point the way, leave signposts and little instructions in various books that are now called holy and worshipped for the cover of the book and not for what it says, but the instructions are all there for all to see, have always been and always will be. There's nothing new under the sun. All the roads lead to Rome. And people cannot provide it for you. I can't wake you up. You can wake you up. I can't cure you. You can cure you.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.716564+00	228	13

4501	At the end of your life you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend or a parent.	2025-07-02 10:17:32.791984+00	2012	13

4523	You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I lived through this horror.

4658	A thought which does not result in an action is nothing much, and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all.	2025-07-02 10:17:35.789595+00	2078	13

4669	During my second year of nursing school our professor gave us a quiz. I breezed through the questions until I read the last one: "What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?" Surely this was a joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Before the class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our grade. "Absolutely," the professor said. "In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say hello." I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.01476+00	2083	13

4678	Just as iron rusts from disuse, and stagnant water putrefies, or when cold turns to ice, so our intellect wastes unless it is kept in use.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.169913+00	544	13

4683	When one door closes another door opens; but we so often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door, that we do not see the ones which open for us.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.274157+00	2087	13
4684	The true secret of giving advice is, after you have honestly given it, to be perfectly indifferent whether it is taken or not, and never persist in trying to set people right.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.29567+00	2088	13
4685	Ruth and I don't have a perfect marriage, but we have a great one. How can I say two things that seem so contradictory? In a perfect marriage, everything is always the finest and best imaginable; like a Greek statue, the proportions are exact and the finish is unblemished. Who knows any human being lke that? For a marriage couple to expect perfection in each other is unrealistic.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.318079+00	2089	13
4686	The unblemished ideal exists only in happily-ever-after fairy tales. Ruth likes to say, "If two people agree on everything, one of them is unnecessary." The sooner we accept that as a fact of life, the better we will be able to adjust to each other and enjoy togetherness. "Happily incompatible" is a good adjustment.	2025-07-02 10:17:36.335306+00	2089	13
4687	The notion that any one person can describe 'what really happened' is an absurdity. If ten - or a hundred - people witness an event, there will be ten - or a hundred - different versions of what took place.

4708	SAT tests are designed by huge panels of experts in education and psychology who work for years to design tests in which not one single question measures any bit of knowledge that anyone might actually need in the real world.

4721	Within their own sex, men bond more easily than women, but women bond more effectively.

5136	Senility - is the level of struggle with your own passions.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.433811+00	2262	13
5137	Don't forget that when you become famous and great, your devil will be egoism and your king will be self-esteem, and they will do their best to destroy your soul and mind.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.45383+00	2263	13
5138	The best praise  - is the one told by the person, to whom you did nothing good.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.473918+00	2264	13
5139	We are all guilty in someone's eyes. More so our own.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.493472+00	2265	13
5140	Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.510023+00	72	13
5141	Since we can be sure that the Devil fears damnation, beware of men who fear death.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.529725+00	2266	13
5142	Peace is not an absence of war; it is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.549495+00	2267	13
5143	May I take the ridiculous position of saying that I do not like the way [Andre] Gide exalts the body. He asks it to restrain its desire to make it keener. Thus he comes dangersouly near to those who in brothel slang are called involved or brain-workers. Christianity also wants to suspend desire. But, more natural, it sees a mortification in this. My friend Vincent, who is a cooper and junior breast-stroke champion, has an even clear veiw. He drinks when he is thirsty, if he desires a woman he tries to go to bed with her, and would marry her if he loved her (this hasn't yet happened). Afterward he says: "I feel better"-- and this sums up vigorously any apology that might be made for satiety.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.566419+00	569	13
5144	O my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.585037+00	2268	13
5145	Walk on air against your better judgement.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.603058+00	2269	13
5146	Life is but a game of solitare, you play it alone and deal with the cards you are dealt.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.62238+00	2270	13
5147	True men of this world do not wish. They change that which they know can be changed, they accept what cannot, and they always strive for the wisdom to know the difference.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.640992+00	2271	13
5148	OFFICER: You really are a clown Lawrence.\nT.E. LAWRENCE: Well, we can't all be lion-tamers.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.655313+00	\N	13
5149	God, give us grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, courage to change the things which should be changed, and the wisdom to distinguish the one from the other.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.673723+00	2272	13
5150	The fish trap exists because of the fish; once you have got the fish, you can forget about the trap. The rabbit snare exists because of the rabbit; Once you have the rabbit, you can forget the snare. Words exist because of meaning; once you have got the meaning, you forget the words. Where can I find a man who has forgotten words so that I can have a word with him?	2025-07-02 10:17:44.694668+00	2273	13
5151	To know that we know what we know and that which we do not know we do not know: This is true knowledge.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.709551+00	348	13
5152	Tell me, and I will forget. Show me, and I will remember. Let me do it, and I will understand.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.728239+00	2274	13
5153	The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.746976+00	104	13
5154	There is no greatness where simplicity, goodness and truth are absent.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.763463+00	273	13
5155	The prime necessities for success in life are money, athleticism, tailor made clothes and a charming smile.	2025-07-02 10:17:44.779795+00	116	13
5156	One of the great challenges in this world is knowing enough about a subject to think you're right, but not enough about the subject to know you're wrong.	2025-07-03 13:11:59.544965+00	455	13
2797	You know... when you are sad you love the sunsets.	2025-07-02 10:16:59.673272+00	664	9
